00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.800
'In a journey to everywhere'

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.300
'Between cities and nations'

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.200
'In the presence of the Wise Remembrance'

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.900
'The Lord of all hearts Has unified us... Has unified us all.'

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.700
'And for the sake of memorizing the book'

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.800
'We have knocked every door'

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:51.400
'We shall continue this right path, before things come to an end'

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.800
We have learned many ways to help us reflect upon the speech 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.300
of Allah SWT

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.900
Together, we will learn more to be able to contemplate these

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.000
great verses

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.900
One of important the things we should care to know

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.500
is the objectives of each surah

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.700
When we read the Qur'an, one surah through to the other,

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.000
We forget to pause to think about the messages of each surah,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.300
connecting the topics and the themes it had deliberated

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.300
Let me be more elaborate,

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.100
When you read surat Al- Fatihah

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.000
Which we read several times daily

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.300
If we want to reflect upon this surah,

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.500
We need to understand the topics covered in this surah

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.900
It is a great surah that has summed up the bases of 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.100
both religion and life collectively

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Allah SWT says;" [All] praise is [due] to Allah, Lord of the worlds-"

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.100
" The Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful,"

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.900
" Sovereign of the Day of Recompense."

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.700
The topic here is the Doctrine [ Aqeeda] and

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.400
the oneness of Allah SWT.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.100
When you read ;" It is You we worship and You we ask for help."

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.800
here comes worshiping of Allah,

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.900
Have you noticed the topic change?

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.100
1- Aqeeda, 2- worshiping

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.100
Then he said;" Guide us to the straight path -"

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.000
" The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor, "

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.100
" not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray."

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.500
A life path

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.900
This great surah consisted of three topics

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.400
Every surah you read, look for its topics

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.200
What its messages are?

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.000
what are the lessons we convey from it?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.900
For example, surat Al-Kahf,

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.400
It has four parts in the form of four trials and tests 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.900
The first is the story of the companions in the cave,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.000
They were tested in their belief

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.100
Then comes the lessons we get from this story

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.800
secondly, is the story of the owners of the two gardens

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.400
Their wealth was their test

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.000
We have lessons here to look at

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.000
Thirdly comes the story of Moses and Al-Khider,  

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.700
Where the Knowledge is the test

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.000
And finally, the story of Dhu-Al-Qarnien,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.900
Where you will know that authority is the subject of testing

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.200
All these 4 temptations are brought by Antichrist

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.300
How can we protect ourselves from the temptations of the Antichrist?

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.700
The prophet SAW said to read and memorize the first 10 verses

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.200
of surat Al-Kahf.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.000
This is how we can learn, and how we contemplate!

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.300
This is the way of teaching of the great Qur'an

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.800
Get the lessons and the topics of the surahs

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.100
This is the correct way, by the will of Allah 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.400
for reflecting upon the speech of Allah SWT 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.900
' It is a design for life rules'

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.200
' for our hearts it's a life guard'

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.900
' It contains lessons and ranks'

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.600
' And the way of success in Dunya and Deen' 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.000
Now, we are flying to Lombok island, Indonesia

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.800
The pilots allowed me inside their cabin

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:10.000
The view is very beautiful from here, Glory to Allah SWT

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:17.600
Lombok Island is famous for 'the Island of Hufadh' 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.200
So many Hufadh are on this island

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.200
I ask Allah SWT to make our trip successful

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:28.500
All our efforts are dedicated to show the Glory of the Noble Qur'an

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.800
'with it, I shorten my long journey'

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.500
'and blessings in my heart increase'

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.900
'In the presence of the Worthy Remembrance' 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.100
'the soul is always pleased with that company' 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.400
'A light of goodness for life'

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.000
'we aim with it towards  Allah '

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.200
'and it wanders  along all roads'

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.900
'a light glows with brightness'

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.300
One of the distinguished centers for memorization of the Our'an

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:17.900
at Lombok Island.., by Allah, at Indonesia as a whole

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.800
compared by the number of perfect hufadh they have in this school;

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.500
The Al-Azizia Institute

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.100
- Asalam Alikum, How are you?

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.300
[Sheikh Fahad Al-Kandari, Imam of the Big Masjid in Kuwait]

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.900
- By the will of Allah, Are you good Sheikh Mustafa?

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.100

Ma'sha'Allah, praise to the Entirely Merciful

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.900
- Amazing place

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.700
- This place is established by Sheikh Mustafa

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.600
- The Azizia Institute, Lombok Island

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.000
- We are very happy to be in this place

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:31.800
-This great scene is very impressive for me and for our show team

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.900
- there are about 2 thousands of students here

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.800
- It is really remarkable!

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.900
- Ma'sha'Allah, praise to the Entirely Merciful

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.100
- The surrounding is joyful in Al-Azizia Institute

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:49.100
- With me here is the founder of this famous Institute

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.000
- in Indonesia and the surrounding countries

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.400
- Sheikh Mustafa Omar Abdul-Aziz

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.800
- He named this Institute after his grand-father Abdul-Aziz

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.100
- And because he also taught in Al-Azizia in Makkah

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.200
- So the name worked out both..
- Both ways

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.700
- How are you sheikh?
- Praise to Allah

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.800
- By the will of Allah, Are you good?

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.900
- Sheikh Mustafa Omar Abdul-Aziz built this distinguished center 

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:19.100
- at 1985 after he came back from Makkah Almukaramah, Saudi Arabia

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:24.300
- He was teaching Hadeeth and Tafseer in the Haram of Makkah 

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.600
- For 11 years

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.900
- This was the dream of sheikh Mustafa Omar,
[ Muhammad Redwan]

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:34.000
- To have his own Institute for memorization of the Qur'an

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.400
- He started his project by a Masjid in his village

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:45.800
- We established this Institute especially for memorization of the Noble Qur'an

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:54.500
- Praise to Allah, we have students boys and girls

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:58.300
- You have female students too sheikh?
- Yes

00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.800
- How many female students?

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.000
- About seven hundreds

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.100
- Ma'sha'Allah, praise to the Entirely Merciful

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.800
- Yes
- 700 students

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:11.800
- After he consulted his family, he sold all his property

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:16.500
Imagine that, He sold all the farms he had, to build this 

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.900
Qur'anic Institute

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.000
This is the real trade, with Allah SWT

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.500
Now there is more than 2000 students in this institute

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.800
More than 300 graduated from this institute

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.800
They memorized the whole Qur'an

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.000
How lucky you are, sheikh Mustafa!

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
" Say, 'I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak'"

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:46.600
" 'From the evil of that which He created' "

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.900
" 'And from the evil of darkness when it settles' "

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:59.900
" 'And from the evil of the blowers in knots' "

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:06.100
" 'And from the evil of an envier when he envies.' "

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.000
- For how long you've been here in this Institute?

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.900
- Three. [ Matara mubarak]
- Three years.

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.800
- Yes.
- Ma'sha'Allah, praise to the Entirely Merciful

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.000
- How old are you now?
- Thirteen

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.500
- Thirteen years, Ma'sha'Allah, praise to the Entirely Merciful

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.200

- By the will of Allah
- Ready! By the will of Allah.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:29.500
"And the companions of Paradise will call out"

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.200
" to the companions of the Fire,"

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:39.200
" 'We have already found what our Lord promised us to be true.' "

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:44.900
"And the companions of Paradise will call out"

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.200
" to the companions of the Fire,"

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:58.300
" 'We have already found what our Lord promised us to be true.' "

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:04.000
" 'Have you found what your Lord promised to be true?' "

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:09.400
" They will say, 'Yes.' Then an announcer will announce among them,"

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:14.500
" 'The curse of Allah shall be upon the wrongdoers.' "

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:20.100
" Who averted [people] from the way of Allah "

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.000
" and sought to make it [seem] deviant"

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.800
" while they were, concerning the Hereafter, disbelievers."

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.900
- Ma'sha'Allah, Ma'sha'Allah, Sheikh!

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.500
- May Allah bless you, Oh Lord

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.000
At Al- Azizia Institute,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.200
it takes about 3 to 4 years to memorize the whole Qur'an

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:47.000
Remember, they do not speak Arabic as a language

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:13.100
" Our Lord, indeed we have heard a caller calling to faith, [saying],"

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:20.200
"  'Believe in your Lord,' and we have believed."

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:26.000
" Our Lord, so forgive us our sins "

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.300
"  and remove from us our misdeeds "

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:37.100
" and cause us to die with the righteous."

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.000
- Seeing this great gathering 

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.000
- This great and beautiful Qur'anic congregation

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
-It came to my mind the Hadeeth,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.800
- From the prophet, May peace and blessings be upon him

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.900
- He said;" Seven whom Allah will have them in his Shade," 

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.000
- " When there is no shade but his almighty;"

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.100
- Of them is "a young man who grew up in the worship of Allah."

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.500
- And the best worship you would do growing up,

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:07.400
- is memorizing the Noble Qur'an

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.900
- It is a pleasure for me to see you memorize the Qur'an

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.300
- in Indonesia with this accuracy. 

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.700
- And by the will of Allah, You are to expect your place in Jannah

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:23.100
- And your rank in Jannah is according to the number of verses

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.700
- you memorized,

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:29.900
' Elevate just because you have memorize, oh Muslim!'

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:35.100
' Elevate to the Firdos level, and meet the Giver'

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:40.100
' Elevate for that you spent much effort to memorize it'

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:45.300
' And you worked on it by your actions and by teaching it'

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.800
To give you an idea of how perfect are the Hufadh of this Institute,

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:58.600
The Ministry of Endowment of Qatar, needed 20 Imams from Indonesia,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.500
Their choice was from graduates from this school only

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.700
- How long did it take you to memorize the Qur'an?

What is his story with the Qur'an? Sheikh Ahmed Menor

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000
" To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth."

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:03.700
" Whether you show what is within yourselves or conceal it,"

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:08.300
" Allah will bring you to account for it. "

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.100

- How do you reflect upon the speech of Allah SWT?

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:45.700
- For example, Allah SWT says,

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.100
" So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny?"

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.700

and going to classes and schoolyards

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:03.400
I feel real happiness when I am with the hafadh of 

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.800
the Book of Allah Almighty

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.000
They suffered a lot to memorize the Qur'an

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.900
Including, not knowing the Arabic language

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:13.100
Now, I see most of them learned Arabic

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.600
and began to memorize the Qur'an,

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.900
I ask Allah SWT to make them all from the hufadh

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:21.000
of the Book of Allah Almighty to fulfill what Allah said

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
" Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur'an "

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.300
