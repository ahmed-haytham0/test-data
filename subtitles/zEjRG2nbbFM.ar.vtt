00:00:01.425 --> 00:00:04.175
 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.220
 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.800
Ruling on Hajj for parents who are unable to perform Hajj

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.800
 

00:00:14.475 --> 00:00:15.985
 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.020
 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.800
I have the intention to challenge them

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.200
 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.760
but the problem is that they are so great that they can not afford to just travel

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.260
as well as performing rituals Hajj from Tawaaf,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.240
Sai 'and throwing Jamar

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.340
is it permissible for them to do Hajj, or do I have to do Hajj for them?

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.120
My father and mother did not perform Hajj until now

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.600
I have an intention to send them for Hajj

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.200
but the problem is that they

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.540
are so great that they can not afford to just travel

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.880
as well as performing rituals Hajj from Tawaaf, Sai 'and throwing Jamar

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.260
is it permissible for them to do Hajj,

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.620
or do I have to do Hajj for them?

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.600
Do they advise me that Allaah rewarded you with good?

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.480
It is permissible for you to perform Hajj for each one alone, starting with the mother and then the father. This is the best

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.060
the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was asked. Abu Ruzin al-Aqili asked him,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.840
O Messenger of Allaah!" My father is a great sheikh who can not perform Hajj or Hajj

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.680
and I do not have the right to do Hajj and 'Umrah

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.640
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: "Do Hajj on behalf of your father and 'Umrah

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:43.420
If you see that someone else is better than you for his knowledge and his preference

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:53.580
and agreed with him that he should do Hajj for them, that is fine. Yeah.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.160
