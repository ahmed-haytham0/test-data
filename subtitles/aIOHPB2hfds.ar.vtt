00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.240
Seven hundred years earlier,

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.280
the prophet Micah had foretold that 
the Messiah-King would be born in Bethlehem,

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.760
the ancient hometown of King David.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.480
But there was a problem.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.240
Mary and Joseph lived in Nazareth,
a three-day journey to the north.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.840
How would the Scriptures be fulfilled?

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.440
God had everything under control.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.320
As the time approached for Mary to give birth,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.760
the Roman Emperor Caesar Augustus issued a decree

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.540
that all subjects of the empire must
return at once to the city of their ancestors

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.640
to register to pay taxes.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.020
So Joseph and a very-pregnant Mary 
traveled from Nazareth to Bethlehem.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.860
While they were there, the time came 
for the baby to be born,

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.060
and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.360
She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger,

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.420
because there was no room for them in the inn.
(Luke 2:6-7)

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:38.100
There in Bethlehem, overcrowded with 
weary travelers (in town for the tax registration),

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.360
the promised Offspring of a woman was born.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.580
The Gospel records the event with precision: 
She gave birth to her firstborn, a son. (Luke 2:6)

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.600
On His mother’s side, 
this baby was the newborn son of Mary,

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.260
but on His Father’s side, He was the eternal Son of God.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:09.920
The same Word by which God created the world, 
the same Voice which thundered from fiery Mount Sinai

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:14.720
could now be heard in a baby’s soft cry.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.440
And where was He born?

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.220
Not in the palace of a king, not in a hospital,
not even in a wayside inn.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.220
The King from heaven was born 
where baby lambs are born—

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.440
in a barn, with a feeding trough for His bed.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.300
It was all part of God’s plan.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.940
For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.800
that though he was rich,  
yet for your sakes he became poor,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.280
so that you through his poverty might become rich. 
(2 Corinthians 8:9)

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:01.740
But couldn’t God have arranged some sort of 
celebration to honor the arrival of His Son?

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.680
He did.
