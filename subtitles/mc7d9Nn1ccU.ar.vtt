00:00:58.905 --> 00:00:59.905
 

00:01:00.595 --> 00:01:02.155
 

00:01:03.905 --> 00:01:04.995
 

00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:06.855
 

00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:12.125
 

00:01:12.335 --> 00:01:13.335
 

00:01:15.685 --> 00:01:17.575
 

00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:20.105
 

00:01:21.635 --> 00:01:23.815
 

00:01:26.825 --> 00:01:28.935
 

00:01:31.935 --> 00:01:32.935
 

00:01:34.135 --> 00:01:35.545
 

00:01:44.305 --> 00:01:45.305
 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.955
While we were in the restaurant waiting to prepare the food

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.600
We saw these two beautiful girls

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.800
And we would love to take their opinion on Yemeni food

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.580
What do you think about Yemeni food ?

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.200
nice

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.460
only nice ? or very nice ? or normal ?

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.520
very nice

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.360
and you what do you think ?

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.040
nice and tasty

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.020
Dears, we have reached the important stage

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.840
I respect the songs and the arts , but the food is what really important

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.240
 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.420
 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.280
Abo Hamad will help us and explain about the food

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.320
because our information is not enough at all

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.860
Let's start one by one

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:36.980
 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.980
 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.980
 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.060
all of these items are eaten with bread, right?

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.460
right , so lets talk about the bread first

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.200
 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.460
 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.760
this one is the wet Bread

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.340
 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.940
Fried bread with black seeds

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.420
 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.800
the other one is Al Rashoush bread

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.980
 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.160
 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.040
Let's start  by this one

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.940
this one is Chicken Okda with vegetables

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.820
 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.340
 

00:03:25.345 --> 00:03:28.095
 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.980
 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.800
also meat Okda is available

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.160
 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.180
There are many types of Yemeni food

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.380
These plates are made of clay so they retain heat for a long time

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.880
 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.660
 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.980
this one is Fahsa with meat

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.620
 

00:03:51.625 --> 00:03:54.475
also available with Chicken

00:03:54.475 --> 00:03:57.565
 

00:03:57.565 --> 00:04:00.575
 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.740
 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.160
also with vegetables but it is completely different taste from Okda

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.075
 

00:04:10.075 --> 00:04:12.665
 

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:16.255
 

00:04:16.255 --> 00:04:19.475
 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.700
 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.320
the next one is Salta

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.820
 

00:04:26.315 --> 00:04:27.385
 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.040
 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.280
It also tastes different and includes okra and fenugreek

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.220
 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.760
 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.700
With different spices and potatoes

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.520
 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.800
so it is completely different from the two before it

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.360
 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.800
This beans cooked in Yemeni way

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.360
 

00:04:55.365 --> 00:04:56.365
 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.800
 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.240
We have three types of Shakshouka and this is one of them

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.240
 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.160
 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.860
and this is sheep liver

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.920
 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.400
It is cooked in a special way

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.460
 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.680
 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.300
and this is Beans

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:26.400
 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.420
 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:28.360
 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.500
and this one is the queen of Yemeni food

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.400
They call it Sabaya

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.120
It is a meal prepared on occasions and in every Yemeni house

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.680
 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.240
 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.620
we will try one by one

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.300
stay with us to discover the taste

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.820
In the name of God

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.420
 

00:06:02.355 --> 00:06:03.355
 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.680
 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.740
We started with the chicken Okda

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.580
and it is not 10 on 10  ,  it is 100 on 10

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.080
 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.500
 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.880
also Fahsa is very delicious

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.120
The spices you have are really delicious

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.420
It is a Yemeni spice

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.700
 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.020
We really don't know what to say

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.160
Great bread taste with great food taste

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.120
The amazing taste is hard to describe , I want to cry

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.275
 

00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:41.685
 

00:06:42.125 --> 00:06:45.135
 

00:06:45.135 --> 00:06:46.325
 

00:06:47.095 --> 00:06:48.125
 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.040
 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.440
 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.520
Okda is number 1 , Salta   is number 2 , Fahsa is number 3

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.600
 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.880
lets try the Yemeni Bean

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:05.320
 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.780
 

00:07:07.665 --> 00:07:08.665
 

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.820
 

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.880
 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.180
The beans are also delicious

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.400
 

00:07:17.765 --> 00:07:20.725
 

00:07:20.965 --> 00:07:23.285
 

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.100
 

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.880
 

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.100
If you want to eat Shakshouka, you must eat Yemeni Shakshouka

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.600
 

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.220
 

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.880

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.720
 

00:07:49.185 --> 00:07:50.185
 

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:56.765
 

00:07:56.765 --> 00:07:59.915
 

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.100
the next level came

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.380
 

00:08:04.945 --> 00:08:06.095
 

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.185
 

00:08:09.185 --> 00:08:12.320
This is a gas grilled chicken with Bashawar rice

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.255
 

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.460
and this is a Mandi chicken , very famous

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.460
 

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.140
and this is a Mandi lamb

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.960
and this is a Mathbi chicken

00:08:25.965 --> 00:08:29.260
 

00:08:29.975 --> 00:08:30.975
 

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.000
this is Adani Zorbian lamp

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.505
Dear viewers, after this delicious war is over

00:08:39.505 --> 00:08:40.500
 

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.180
 

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:45.560
Actually the food was very tasty

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:50.760
We have reached the important moment that Abu Abdullah has been waiting for since we entered the restaurant

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.260
 

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.365
 

00:08:54.365 --> 00:08:57.355
Al Maasob is one of my favorite dessert since 17 years

00:08:57.355 --> 00:09:00.175
I am addicted to Maasoab , Take it as an intravenous injection

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.520
 

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.500
As far as I know it is made from chopped Yemeni Tawa bread with banana

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.580
Cream, honey and grated kraft cheese are added to it

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.140
 

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:16.640
 

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.180
 

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.720
so you can imagine how is the taste

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.260
 

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.680
for me ,the first time Abu Abdullah let me try it

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.840
I didn't like it very much

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.595
 

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.605
but after two or three times , I love it too much

00:09:35.605 --> 00:09:38.515
 

00:09:38.515 --> 00:09:41.685
 

00:09:41.685 --> 00:09:44.320
 

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.160

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.920
 

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.500
According to what Abu Hamad told me, it contains dates instead of bananas

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.520
 

00:09:58.915 --> 00:10:01.985
 

00:10:01.985 --> 00:10:02.980
 

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.220
