00:00:11.833 --> 00:00:15.533
There is a very serious issue that extremists have misused

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.999
And misguided a lot of people with

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.400
And we must understand it correctly in our religion

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.833
They said that there is something called governance, 

00:00:22.833 --> 00:00:27.599
Meaning that we are being ruled by infidel laws that do not relate to religion.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.666
Therefore we can’t obey such infidel government laws 

00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:33.066
Backing up their argument with this verse from the qur’an

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:36.499
“If any do fail to judge by the light of what Allah hath revealed,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.500
They are no better than Unbelievers.”

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.066
A verse we all know in the qur’an

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:44.532
But, there are seven basic concepts we must know to understand this verse properly

00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:47.899
What does  “If any do fail to judge by what Allah hath revealed,

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.066
They are Unbelievers.” mean?

00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:53.499
First of all, there are levels of of not judging by God’s laws

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.500
Which include disbelief and denial and also include neglect and dereliction

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.166
The first two are true infidelity and the second are shameful sins.

00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:08.499
And given that we have not seen any of today’s muslim countries in the entire islamic world

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.500
Denying publicly or privately ruling by God’s laws

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.300
Then all that they’re saying is wrong.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.833
Secondly, most constitutions of the islamic world clearly state 

00:01:21.833 --> 00:01:27.599
That the principles of islamic laws (sharia) are the main source of governing laws.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.566
Thirdly, describing the laws as infidelities distant from religion 

00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:34.499
Is very unjust.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.233
The laws are derived from (sharia) islamic laws 

00:01:37.233 --> 00:01:39.966
Because a lot of the laws are made for the benefits of the people

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.400
Therefore, they are achieving the goals of (sharia) 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.566
Religious law because the goal or purpose of sharia 

00:01:46.566 --> 00:01:49.499
In the first place is sustaining the benefits of the people.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.333
Fourthly, everything in alignment with the purposes of sharia 

00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:55.566
from protecting souls, minds, religion, families, and money 

00:01:55.566 --> 00:01:57.799
Is from God’s laws.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.500
Therefore the goals of the laws are achieving the purpose of sharia laws.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.933
Fifth, across the course of history, muslims understood 

00:02:07.933 --> 00:02:13.866
That islam is applying provisions with the purpose of achieving the wellbeing of people’s interests 

00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:17.666
And that the obstruction of some sentences like certain punishments

00:02:17.666 --> 00:02:20.766
Happens either for missing one of the conditions making it applicable 

00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:22.899
Or for emergency circumstances

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.866
Also for the wellbeing of the people and not in defiance of God’s laws.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.400
Like Omar Ibn Al Khattab did in the year of the starvation,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.333
He disabled the punishment for stealing,

00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:35.666
Was that an act of defiance of God’s laws?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.400
Of course not! But he kept into consideration the time and place and circumstances

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.766
When applying religious laws

00:02:42.766 --> 00:02:45.432
Sixth, if we assume that a law has been passed 

00:02:45.433 --> 00:02:48.199
That’s incompatible with sharia laws what do we do? 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.333
We turn to the constitutional court

00:02:50.333 --> 00:02:55.433
Because the role of the constitutional court is to cancel any law that’s incompatible with sharia laws

00:02:55.433 --> 00:02:56.866
But, in a civilized way 

00:02:56.866 --> 00:02:59.632
And not in an unorganized and violent way

00:02:59.633 --> 00:03:01.933
Or through individual actions.

00:03:01.933 --> 00:03:04.199
Finally and after all what we said, 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.100
If someone is insisting on a wrong idea,

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.366
Then they are the ones that are following laws other than God’s.

00:03:11.933 --> 00:03:13.933
And religion disapproves of their actions,

00:03:13.933 --> 00:03:17.333
Because then all they truly seek is to coat righteousness with wrongness 

00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:18.999
For a personal inclination.
