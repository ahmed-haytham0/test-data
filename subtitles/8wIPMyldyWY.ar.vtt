00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160
Warning This video does not belong to any political party but only describes the case of an Egyptian citizen completely defeated

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.160
موسيقا

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.040
Excuse

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.560
Have you gone to the polls?

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.080
elections

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.440
Where are the election

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.780
Are there elections? Did you see the elections?

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.460
No one saw the election

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.960
You did not attend the elections

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.460
 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.300
He went down and was elected from whether anyone knew one of the elected

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.100
What I know and see is that there are people who hang pictures of people on the street

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.700
From above the pictures the money is equivalent to 15 or 20 thousand pounds

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.340
And they took pictures of those who worked like this

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.680
They write the cannon code

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.980
The citizen is supposed to fall in love and elect them

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.980
He says this is who will be elected

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.900
Also we dropped the proposal boxes what boxes did the proposal

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.380
I also came down and elected President Morsi

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.980
I waited to do anything to the country and did nothing

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.360
President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was elected and did not do anything

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.020
President Sisi is the best ruler of the country

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.540
We did not see who was good and protected the country well

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.020
Cigarettes priced too much

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.020
Cigarettes we see in advertisements only

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.440
We used to get angry when the price of meat now increases, so we do not even have to eat plants

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.440
The price of vegetables has become too much

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.440
My times come with pepper and convince me that it is

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.820
Transportation, which was 1 pound now 5 pounds

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.920
I came to 5 pounds until I take a bus and I'm not with me until I enter the bathroom

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.520
Did not try to ride private transport

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.600
Private transport is a taboo

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.040
the Internet is very bad

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.140
I can not open my Facebook page

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.140
Light is cut day and night and there is no water

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.600
My sweetheart can not find a mike or something to decorate me

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.340
I am an Egyptian citizen I have lost my love because there is nothing to wear except Abaya only

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.340
She migrated and married others

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.460
There is nothing good in the country

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.740
I am a citizen with a cup of tea and drugs and forget about life

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.420
And children

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.900
My children left school and went to work

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.900
You did not enter schools

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.860
Schools What I do not have the price of food how to enter schools

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:26.840
Whichever child does not come from this learns and goes to the university and spend a lot of money after this and take his testimony to the house and come down in one of the workshops

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.700
Place of the first one to go to one of the workshops without education

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.700
Do you want to send a letter to officials in the country?

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.660
Yes, I want to send a message to the officials in the country, I want to not prevent drugs

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.160
As an Egyptian citizen, I do not know how to live and you are in power without drugs

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.160
If drugs are banned in the country I will pretend

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.520
Even though it is forbidden to pretend, it is still pretending

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.520
Even if I kill, I will pretend

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.620
I can not live and you rule the country without drugs
