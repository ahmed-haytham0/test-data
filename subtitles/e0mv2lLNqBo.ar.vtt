00:00:00.425 --> 00:00:01.425
 

00:00:01.425 --> 00:00:03.905
 

00:00:04.165 --> 00:00:05.165
 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.120
 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.240
Ruling on the last days of Ramadaan until the following Ramadaan

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:26.000
Also this is Mohammed Nasif Muti or Matri says: I left some days of

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.880
Ramadan last year, and I am embarrassed where they will judge me or Ramadan

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.880
This year, should I leave fasting after Ramadaan and fast, or fast for Ramadan?

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:45.860
Last, then I start with Muslims in fasting this month?

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.060
She returns the question

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:56.460
He said: I missed some days of Ramadan last year, and I am afraid that they will help me, or say

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:03.880
Ramadan raged me this year, and I did not deafen the rest of Ramadan last year.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:13.980
Will I fast last year or leave it and postpone it and fast with Muslims? Ramadan this year that we?

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.580
The questioner and the jurisprudent of Allaah have to initiate fasting in this remaining period, and to judge
 Fasting

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.640
This duty is done before Ramadan, and it is not permissible for him to delay and indulge,

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.560
But if he is overcome as a disease prevented him from fasting, he fast after Ramadan,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.500
He has to feed a poor person for every day

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.280
Because of the leniency I resort to delay, but now it is necessary to fast

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.300
He has to take the initiative and fast what he has to do before Ramadan. This is the duty

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.000
Unless he is prevented from the disease, such as the disease could not be delayed

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.700
If he is incapacitated because of sickness until Ramadaan comes, he will delay it and fast after Ramadaan, God willing

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.200
He has to feed a poor person for every day

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.820
Because it is lenient to delay before the illness, but if it is delayed due to sickness throughout the year

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.960
I mean: from the time he fasted in sickness until now in sickness until Ramadan came, there is nothing but Spend

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.680
He will then spend the day if Allaah will make up for him after Ramadaan and nothing will be done for him

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:23.200
The one who delayed fasting is lenient and does not have to look after it

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.280
And he has to cook and feed if he delays it until after Ramadaan

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.200
But if he fasts in Rajab or in Sha'baan, there is nothing wrong with that. Yeah
