Silence 2
Lessons from the Maasai

00:00:25.455 --> 00:00:28.255
Over a million people belong to the Maasai tribes

00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:44.527
From a young age a Maasai 
becomes a SHEPHERD

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:56.522
They learn to jump a meter off the 
ground to become FIGHTERS

00:01:03.878 --> 00:01:07.717
Every piece has a MEANING

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:14.165
Some of them depict a MAP of the village

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.466
CONVICTION surpasses wealth

00:01:22.514 --> 00:01:29.232
The tribe has a group of fighters 
who PROTECT it

00:01:30.735 --> 00:01:37.010
A LION might be faster than them
but they run can longer DISTANCES

00:01:38.901 --> 00:01:43.845
The ELDERS of the tribe
act as COUNSELLERS

00:01:49.751 --> 00:01:54.718
For the EXPERIENCE of the elderly is a treasure

00:02:01.548 --> 00:02:06.483
They eat TO LIVE, 
and don't live to eat

00:02:10.982 --> 00:02:15.851
WOMEN are the bedrock of their societies

00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:35.362
