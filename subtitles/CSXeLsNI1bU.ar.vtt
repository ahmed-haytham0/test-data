00:00:02.055 --> 00:00:03.245
 

00:00:04.035 --> 00:00:06.935
 

00:00:07.165 --> 00:00:09.635
 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.380
 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.240
Azzam... how are you doing?

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.140
Whether what you do is magic or Sleight of hand...

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.560
It will not make a difference

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.780
The problem is that people do as many things as you do 20 times

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.880
And they enjoy us more than this

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.500
Like David Cooperfield.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.180
So the question ....
Why are you doing this?

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.700
If this was magic..... You are a Muslim,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.800
and even if you are a Christian, Christianity also forbids this.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.480
If you are a Muslim or a Christian, they forbid magic in general.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.860
But if you have a superpower that You called it a sleight hand.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.020
So we have a problem....

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.980
By being an Arabian Muslim

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.980
Our children interact with you more than the foreign magicians

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.820
and they say we want to do this or like this

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.180
But, if you want the general benefit of your country and the Arab nation

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.840
and you can get potatoes from the casserole and pizza from the fire and sugar from the money ....

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.120
Believe me ...
We have a problem

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.520
and we have many problems in our country, You can work on it and be famous and useful more than that

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.900
But the question that we will talk about and talking about it already, It's the evidence.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.340
Firstly  ... I'm accusing you of theft.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.180
That you can know Visas personal confidential number of the people and you can also withdraw their balances

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.120
So you're either a thief or a magician.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.560
And this is important, it's important to respond to it

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.780
The second question is, are you a prophet? Or God?

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.440
Or the hodoo man (warlock) of the era?

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.400
In parentheses means "Antichrist"

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.740
You will ask me why..... I'm going to answer you.....

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.200
You're predicting, of course.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.200
That you made a video that preceded the events of the episode that will happen with Dr. Amr Alithi

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.860
I think that people have the right to know this is why and how....

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.900
I recorded this things yesterday 
Before I came to you the studio today

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.940
Because I predicted, and I know you're going to pick these things.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:02.340
Page number, Calculation, and these numbers
And the potato dish you've cooked now

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.420
And by the way (very tasty)

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.680
The third question is the most important one.....

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.720
You're a misguided man of minds.
And you pretends  the ability

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.940
the ability to do the things you want....  You make the other one execute it in the language of mind control

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.300
Or control the minds of others ... And that was from your tongue.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.560
That you make people say what you want and want what you will say

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.800
So you took from the names of God named (Almighty)...

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.580
And you claimed the divinity by controlling people's minds.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.300
The question ... Why is this   Why are you doing this?

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.420
Uncle Azzam.... If you are a man like people say in Egyptian movies

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.340
in the name of solutions' solver
(An Egyptian sentence called for the dervishes who pay harm to people)

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.640
and you can do everything , controls the people and them minds and predicts and knows the unseen

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.200
And very good in the language of numbers and you can open any phone's password

00:02:48.205 --> 00:02:51.235
and you know how to get food and potatoes and pizza ….etc)

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.140
So By the way our problems are too much

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.340
Instead of showboating that you give charity to people...  you getting defaming to people to being honest with charity.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.780
I would like to tell you that you getting famous by defaming people... And shows that you're a good man (good actor) and talk like that.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.680
How are you ?
Thank God

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.680
What are you going to eat me today, Or what will you do?

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.680
I don't know yet.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.880
So, tell me… What do you like to eat?

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.500
Anything

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.140
any kind of food you have ever seen or you want to break it or you want to try it just tell me

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.580
I see it in the shops

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.580
What do you want to eat ?

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.600
Something in the shape of a rotation like this

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.040
What's it name?

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.920
Pizza

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.660
Pizza??

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.380
So look, I will take this tissue and I'm going to burn it

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.620
So is it possible to turn it to Pizza ?

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.360
Look, we will take this cover and we will put it on the tissue

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.920
What do you want to eat ?

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.920
Pizza

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.920
What is that ?

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.020
With the Ketchup and all things

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.600
Will you eat or what?

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.600
After (Maghrib time Prayer) not now

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.620
No, of course after the fasting time

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.620
Ramadan Kareem

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.500
looks like moon

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.160
Is there anything? no

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.160
Ok, look, what do you wish?

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.480
Chocolate 
And you ?

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.080
Both of you want Chocolate, so open your hands like this

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.100
Let's 1, 2, 3  ….

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.340
Here you are

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.440
Divide it among you

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.380
You gave her a lot …

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.120
Divide it with her

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.900
She take a lot of chocolate

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.640
Do you want a lot of chocolates ?

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.200
YEAH

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.220
Do you have anything inside your bag?
So let's see

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.760
enough , enough

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.520
It is a priority to establish an institution to feed food and solve people's problems,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.460
and put all your powers which you called any name … to benefit the people

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.815
But the question still exists...... Why are you doing this?

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.220
In both cases ... I'd rather you answer.
You are doing this for what?

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.980
By the way.
... Our kids are asking... How does that happen? And I want to be like him.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.040
Some of them want to fly and some of them want to predict and some of them want to get food in casserole

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.860
because they were very happy from the dazzle of Dr. Amr elithy

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.100
We need answers to these questions... At least we can respond to our kids.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.240
Or we are required to take everything like  (a rectal suppository). Just stuffing (for filling only) ,and no mental response.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.980
So we need an answer, please

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.960
So the penultimate question is …

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.900
as you predicted in Dr. Amr's episode, did you also predict that I would make this video?

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.480
And asking you these questions ???

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.280
I think not.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.740
We need answers to every question

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.660
And waiting for a reply from you in a video,

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.420
so that the next one will be harder

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:57.600
And our children need replies and our minds need replies and I think that the whole society needs a response (old before the baby)

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.160
And I will have the right to reply in a way that suits our children and our minds

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.980
My last words.... This is advice.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.560
You should have respected the clerics in the replies
To be full of morals

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.535
There is a Point
Maybe it's sparked public opinion

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.400
And our youth particularly

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.180
In the period last week

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:24.480
So, we had to show our young people the truth about what happened to don't get lost

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.060
What happened is that Mr. Amr Al-Laithi, and he is a dear and respectable friend

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.660
He hosted one of the guys on his show.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.680
And he made an episode with this guy and made some things

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:41.000
that impressed the audience in the show program and impressed the audience generally

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.380
And he interpreted it as a slight of hand.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:50.740
Like we saw. 
Cooking potatoes
He put money in the apple, into the orange,

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.720
and arithmetic stuff happened in the show

00:06:53.720 --> 00:07:01.300
I think most of you
See the topic on social media
And on the Internet.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:07.200
The important thing about the topic is that the employees of the program were impressed and the viewers were impressed

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.360
and we found explanations from here and there.
for what happened.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:17.380
And some might have been fascinated by this guy.
This guy looked weird.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.660
he's an extraordinary person and a very important person and so on

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:27.240
But strangely, some people
Unfortunately, by his tongue …
They started sending him messages.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.760
Some of them want to steal money from the bank.
And give him half of it.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.920
And some of them want to turn the Egyptian pounds into dollars.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.600
And some of them want to solve a problem between someone somewhere.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.620
Strange stories and dubious stories

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.380
I'll say it in a little while.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.960
But I want to tell you my explanation of what happened.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.320
From my point of view and personal opinion

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:58.480
This thing is not going to get out of the magic circle.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.360
In any case, it's absolutely impossible.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.800
This subject has no knowledge and no lightness of hands.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.400
Because it's impossible with the lightness of the hand to get the money into the apple.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.260
No way, I guess.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:17.180
And it's impossible with the lightness of the hand, get hot potatoes and people eat them.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.540
Impossible

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.315
There's no lightness of hand doing this

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:27.200
The sleight of hand is to steal a piece of paper or put a piece of paper in it
He's evasive of you looking somewhere and doing something else

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.880
These things we've been watching in the past.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.000
With the people you call in past time (Hawi) charlatans, or something like that names

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.600
But what happened doesn't have any kind of sleight of hand at all

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.000
The subject from my point of view is nothing more than magic.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.500
I'm surprised there's the same match and the same words.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.220
If Islam forbids magic and sorcery

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:51.900
In the same thought and equally Christianity also forbids magic and sorcery

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:59.700
look, The Bible from the beginning to the end attacks magic and attacks sorcery.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.700
And he demands all believers not to use magic.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.800
Or not to go to the witches.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.260
It is any human being who uses magic

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:16.440
or goes to witches and uses the things they use,

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:25.320
leaves his faith, leaves God, throws his passion and needs witches and charlatans.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:30.240
His fate will be the fire-burning lake, which is the second death.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.160
This guy's doomed, for surly

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:37.980
And it is also the honor of morality (standing on positions) and the convincing and believable response (and respect for people's minds)

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.800
I will wait for the answer....

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:44.840
Otherwise it will be my right to respond in a way that suits our society and our children and our minds

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.160
bye-bye

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.060
 

00:09:50.435 --> 00:09:52.905
 

00:09:53.305 --> 00:09:56.055
 

00:09:57.135 --> 00:09:58.905
 

00:09:59.305 --> 00:10:02.445
 

00:10:02.665 --> 00:10:04.015
