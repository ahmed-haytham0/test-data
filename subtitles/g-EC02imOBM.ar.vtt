00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.280
When your hear the Hadith of the Prophet (PBUH)

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.040
“Act kindly towards women”

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.140
And the Prophet's hadith: "The best of you is the one who is best to his wife

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.580
and I am the best of you to my wives."

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.920
And the hadith:

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.140
“None but an honorable man honors them, and none but a low man insults them”

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.200
Also, his hadith “Be gentle with ladies”

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.920
All of these mean that you should not oppress a woman or insult her

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.000
Because your opponent on judgement day will be the prophet himself

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.620
Why do we say this ?

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.140
Because there are men who misuse their given rights in religion

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.900
Without any mercy or humaneness towards women

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.460
And use quotes and hadiths which are correct however apply them incorrectly

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.940
At all times they can say my rights in religion are so and so

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.580
And if you do so and so, you will be damned or discordant

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.940
All of this is wrong

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.460
They do not seem to understand that these quotes

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.320
and hadiths where mentioned in a context of disagreement

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.440
and not apply to all aspects of the marital relationship

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.340
Because the teachings of Islam guides you to treat your wife

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.640
with mercy, love and grace through all aspects of life

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.680
and not to misuse references that relate to rights or duties

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.180
unless there are disputes

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.000
To be affectionate and merciful is a way of life

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.400
and to apply rights and duties only at moments of disagreement

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.920
This is the correct and accurate perspective of Islam

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.940
Marriage bond in Islam blossoms from love and mercy,

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.680
not from dos and donts in situations of disputes

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.800
Do not take religious provisions about disputes in marriage and apply them to everydays life

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.900
Because in such situations, you will be mistreating your spouse

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.900
And corrupting the truth of the religion

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.200
This is the rightful way of Islam

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.740
One of the main objectives of Surat Anessa' is redeeming the position of women

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.400
As well as respect and appreciation towards them

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.880
#SuratAlNesaa

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.480
Honour women and God will be pleased with you

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.060
Right
