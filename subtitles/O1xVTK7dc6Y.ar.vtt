00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.001
 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.510
A message to the respectable media man Dr. Amr Ellissy ...

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.178
We all commend you as media, journalist and free professional

00:00:32.178 --> 00:00:36.550
And you have an extensive background of professionalism, material and in media content that you offer

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.876
Like your TV shows (one of the people), (clearly) and (No)

00:00:40.876 --> 00:00:45.000
And all the political and social roles and investigations that you have presented

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.951
You have all the appreciation and respect in it

00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:49.309
You've always been a strong defender and a good detective

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.331
You care about people's opinions, and you once cared about people's opinions.

00:00:53.331 --> 00:00:55.343
And you defended yourself in all the TV shows 

00:00:55.343 --> 00:00:56.551
( in the paper)

00:00:56.551 --> 00:00:58.551
Or which is called (the fraudulent document)

00:00:58.551 --> 00:01:00.551
in the accusations that you has been accused of at this time

00:01:00.551 --> 00:01:03.277
And always justify in the language of logic and reason

00:01:03.277 --> 00:01:05.224
and professionalism and neutrality

00:01:05.224 --> 00:01:09.000
on all the questions that are asked to you or inquiries or constructive criticism

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.531
But lately I have heard from you

00:01:11.531 --> 00:01:16.960
(I don't care what the people think, or I don't care about anyone's opinion, and these people don't concern me) or that,

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.747
To make sure the numbers came out by chance.
 

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:23.420
 So that no one says that we agree with each other - (sing from the same hymn sheet)

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.884
ok ? .... I don't care about anyone. 

00:01:26.884 --> 00:01:31.367
These are numbers less than five.I want you to put your finger on any number of them without seeing them.

00:01:31.367 --> 00:01:35.200
although this is contrary to your career,
you have been always careful to respond

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.810
And honestly Dr. Amr I am talking to you about ...

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.963
or worth mentioning in the topic 

00:01:39.963 --> 00:01:42.062
(The Episode of Azzam and His Brothers)

00:01:42.062 --> 00:01:46.498
and the episodes that made a big fuss about what they call (the sleight of hand)

00:01:47.351 --> 00:01:50.390
Welcome
New episode of the program (One of the People)

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.784
Today's episode is very exceptional, very different, very distinct, very very very exciting

00:01:56.784 --> 00:02:04.677
We've given you the last period
A group of talented
In sleight of hand games.

00:02:04.677 --> 00:02:10.252
And we were able to highlight their unique ability and their different abilities 

00:02:10.252 --> 00:02:14.276
And the truth is that these episodes have achieved very high viewership on YouTube

00:02:14.276 --> 00:02:17.714
Because of the excitement and weirdness it contained.

00:02:17.714 --> 00:02:20.792
and today... 
A show full of surprises

00:02:20.792 --> 00:02:22.741
And sleight of hand games

00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:24.449
That never came to mind

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:27.847
Which we can't believe from the weirdness.

00:02:27.847 --> 00:02:31.641
Even though it's happening in front of us.

00:02:31.641 --> 00:02:36.714
 today, in the studio, I have four of the most important players in Sleight of hand

00:02:36.714 --> 00:02:41.311
And they're, Mr.Gino, Mr. Ahmed Abdul Rahman, 

00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:46.013
Mr. Bassam and Mr. Azzam

00:02:46.013 --> 00:02:50.212
Welcome to (One of the people's programs).
I'm so glad you're with me.

00:02:50.212 --> 00:02:54.105
And here's the question....
These episodes have sparked a wide and big debate

00:02:54.105 --> 00:02:56.939
and we are accustomed to you that you are a good investigator

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:59.694
You were doing investigations about criminals and gangs 

00:02:59.694 --> 00:03:02.678
and you've been having a conversation with the utmost objectivity

00:03:02.678 --> 00:03:04.997
and you let reply to the public

00:03:04.997 --> 00:03:07.552
But recently
 (Episode Azzam and his aides)

00:03:07.552 --> 00:03:12.223
We are an Arab eastern Christian Muslim society
 Not an European society

00:03:12.223 --> 00:03:18.067
Honestly .. Honestly , your excellency
Are you convinced that what happened with any one of them,  is that  (a sleight of hand)?

00:03:18.067 --> 00:03:23.141
I mean when he gives you the empty bowl and lets you get the potatoes out 
Are you convinced that is (a sleight of hand)?

00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:26.717
We are used to you to respect people's minds …  

00:03:26.717 --> 00:03:29.363
Where are the minds of the people in these episodes?

00:03:29.363 --> 00:03:32.508
You're offering us someone like (A demigod or demi-god)

00:03:32.508 --> 00:03:34.789
- One arrived to be the Antichrist 

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:36.912
Someone (predicts and knows the unseen)

00:03:36.912 --> 00:03:40.626
And he made an episode the day before and gets potatoes 
he claims to be a will

00:03:40.626 --> 00:03:43.299
We are in front of a character that we adorn it, or characters that we adorn it

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.047
In a Tv-show we all know, knowing by (professionalism and respect)

00:03:47.047 --> 00:03:51.071
And basically we can't fake
 Because this is a falsification of people's awareness

00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:53.601
 And we are not used to this with you

00:03:53.601 --> 00:03:57.678
Except you've shown the subject 
and disowned it and said ......

00:03:57.678 --> 00:04:02.650
in brackets
 (This is not "a sleight of hand", Do you want to convince me that this is a sleight of hand?)

00:04:04.437 --> 00:04:06.897
a sleight of hand to get something out of the sleeve of the jacket

00:04:06.897 --> 00:04:09.498
a sleight of hand to flip number 8, you put it down, and it will be in upstairs.

00:04:09.498 --> 00:04:12.438
this is the sleight of hand, and we saw some people who doing that

00:04:12.438 --> 00:04:14.829
this is not a sleights of hand, you read my thoughts.

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:16.907
But I will reply to what you didn't reply to

00:04:16.907 --> 00:04:18.647
We are in front of (Magician)

00:04:18.647 --> 00:04:23.653
after a short time; he will continue the capabilities of the 99 names 
*(Allah's Most Beautiful Names in Islam religion) 

00:04:23.653 --> 00:04:24.797
And this is not going to happen

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:28.308
And also the situation was not limited to this (to the witches)

00:04:28.308 --> 00:04:31.852
Also we got the super forces

00:04:31.852 --> 00:04:34.525
 which are a big lie

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:45.255
I think it's so obvious.

00:04:45.255 --> 00:04:46.073
in red color

00:04:49.135 --> 00:04:51.135
It's so weird.

00:04:51.135 --> 00:04:53.135
Electric Drill ....
and you didn't feel anything.

00:04:53.135 --> 00:04:55.135
no, Never

00:04:56.728 --> 00:04:59.119
Now I'm going to try to eat glass.

00:04:59.119 --> 00:05:00.548
Are you going to eat the glass?

00:05:00.548 --> 00:05:04.369
yeah ...
ah.... here you are
Enjoy your meal!

00:05:21.501 --> 00:05:24.210
good appetite ... 
hearty appetite....

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.249
so, you had your lunch today, right?

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:27.789
No, it's breakfast.

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:28.891
 it's breakfast.....

00:05:28.891 --> 00:05:31.316
The other is lunch because it fills the stomach.

00:05:31.316 --> 00:05:34.064
Does that glass fill your stomach?
Makes you feel full?

00:05:34.223 --> 00:05:37.243
I want to know what this stuff is when you eat it like that. 
That's glass.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.552
Can I ask you a question

00:05:40.552 --> 00:05:42.534
according to you, you always tell them

00:05:42.534 --> 00:05:44.715
(How did it happen?, Give me a justification or, Give me strong evidence.)

00:05:44.715 --> 00:05:48.833
You don't have enough information about their field or their sciences or their secrets

00:05:48.833 --> 00:05:52.849
You've always been featured in your programs (opinion and differing views) 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:56.465
Where is the role of the other mind in replying to these people and evaluating these people?

00:05:56.465 --> 00:05:59.392
Like Al- Azhar and the opinion of the people of science 

00:05:59.392 --> 00:06:03.642
who can understand and evaluate and respond to the minds of these people and evaluate these people themselves.

00:06:03.978 --> 00:06:06.748
why are just those who don't have to  them (enquiry approach)?

00:06:06.748 --> 00:06:10.449
And you left the opinion to people to hit a fifth in sixes
  (hit them thumsmosts in them teethes)  
or (started to rave and rant about how these happens) 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:13.328
But more than that you personally do not have a reply ….

00:06:13.328 --> 00:06:17.389
So it's a controversial subject or just a show??? I don't think so 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:20.011
You don't need this, Dr. Amr

00:06:20.011 --> 00:06:23.091
Don't polish the copper because it eventually (rusts)

00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:24.844
Because honesty and everyone takes his right

00:06:24.844 --> 00:06:27.352
 Your career history is gold.

00:06:27.352 --> 00:06:30.287
So don't tarnish it for a fuss or what (or propaganda) 

00:06:30.287 --> 00:06:33.445
without looking at the truth or standing on it

00:06:33.445 --> 00:06:35.921
You owe the right to respond to the entire Egyptian people

00:06:35.921 --> 00:06:38.367
As we're used to, you're always respectful.

00:06:38.367 --> 00:06:42.371
We hope from your honor the logical explanation of these events With Absolutely absolutely objective.

00:06:42.371 --> 00:06:44.767
We are not going to do like (Ibrahim Al-Abyad)'s Movie

00:06:44.767 --> 00:06:47.616
When he's been throughout the film, talking about his criminal history

00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:50.034
And he wants people to understand his message in just three minutes

00:06:50.034 --> 00:06:52.212
he explained to people and reached out to them that this is all wrong 

00:06:52.212 --> 00:06:55.490
Thank you to the respectable media 
Dr. Amr Al-Laithi
