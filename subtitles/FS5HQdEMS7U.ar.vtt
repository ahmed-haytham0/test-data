00:00:14.384 --> 00:00:16.492
In the name of Allah,
the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful.

00:00:16.492 --> 00:00:21.000
We had several episodes in which we fought magic and witches...

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.235
and all those who are the "Wizard of words"

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:25.347
who defend themselves to be

00:00:25.347 --> 00:00:28.899
Existentialism is the only way for them...

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:32.406
and the prosecutors of  "special and super-forces" …

00:00:32.406 --> 00:00:34.415
and we shouted to "Al-Azhar" for ....

00:00:34.415 --> 00:00:37.668
the state of our society of magic and magicians

00:00:37.668 --> 00:00:40.424
and guaranteed the right of reply to all...

00:00:40.424 --> 00:00:43.123
and guaranteed the right of reply to all...

00:00:43.123 --> 00:00:46.777
some of them ignored, and some of them were silent ignorance

00:00:46.777 --> 00:00:49.044
so both of them, as sees it...

00:00:49.044 --> 00:00:54.221
and The right of reply is still guaranteed to all ...

00:00:59.724 --> 00:01:02.762
Either we get to which is worse than magic…

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:06.634
There's a magic of minds, and it's a moral voodoo

00:01:06.634 --> 00:01:10.805
won't and never affect anything in (the best of mankind, and the greatest of creation)

00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:15.185
and the absolute freedoms and liberals that have no limits reaches ...

00:01:15.185 --> 00:01:20.314
to cursing the the best of mankind ( Our Master Muhammad "pbuh")

00:01:20.314 --> 00:01:22.968
The purest who calls for freedom ...

00:01:22.968 --> 00:01:25.170
and save the woman her rights,

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.969
and preserve the rights of other religions

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:29.963
and preserve their beliefs.

00:01:29.963 --> 00:01:33.340
The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Beware, if anyone wrongs a contracting man, or diminishes his right, or forces him to work beyond his capacity, or takes from him anything without his consent, I shall plead for him on the Day of Judgment.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.558
Now the curses come to us

00:01:35.558 --> 00:01:38.890
from the West sometimes and from the inside other times

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.915
and they say freedoms...

00:01:41.127 --> 00:01:44.232
and we will bring secularism high ...

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.846
. We will not give up caricatures, drawings,

00:01:50.021 --> 00:01:52.181
even if others back down.

00:01:52.508 --> 00:01:57.016
and everyone has the right to express his/ her thoughts without interference from others

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:59.642
If others are the ones who have been harmed,

00:01:59.642 --> 00:02:01.371
, where is the so-called freedom?

00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:04.334
O West, those who call for freedom.

00:02:04.334 --> 00:02:08.600
Didn't freedom mean that not to exceed the rights of the other?

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.390
and if exceed the rights of the other, it's a violation, not a "freedom"?

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.684
so, What's the difference between "Nazism and dictatorship"  ..... VS

00:02:19.684 --> 00:02:23.184
 and what does "every transgressive ignorant" do to the rights of the other?

00:02:35.184 --> 00:02:40.345
-	For all Muslims in all countries of the world you must take peaceful and legitimate ways

00:02:40.345 --> 00:02:43.896
and the law and the judiciary being the door that knocks

00:02:44.782 --> 00:02:48.924
These cartoons, which are offensive to our great prophet,

00:02:48.924 --> 00:02:52.370
adopted by some newspapers and magazines,

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.243
and even some policies

00:02:54.243 --> 00:03:01.324
are absurd, clowning and depraved from all the constraints of responsibility,

00:03:01.324 --> 00:03:06.085
 moral commitment, international custom and public law,

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:10.558
which is an outright hostility to this religion,

00:03:10.558 --> 00:03:14.666
 and to god's prophet mercy to the worlds.

00:03:14.666 --> 00:03:18.568
We, from the position of Al-Azhar,

00:03:18.568 --> 00:03:24.158
reject with all the countries of the Islamic world and strongly

00:03:24.158 --> 00:03:26.405
reject these obscenities,

00:03:26.405 --> 00:03:31.309
which do not really harm Muslims and prophets,

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:38.415
 but rather offend those who do not know the greatness of this Holy

00:03:38.415 --> 00:03:41.692
Prophet Muhammad
(God's blessing and peace be upon him)

00:03:41.692 --> 00:03:46.763
We call on the international community

00:03:46.763 --> 00:03:52.800
to adopt universal legislation that criminalizes anti-Muslimism

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.106
and discrimination with others, in rights and duties.

00:03:58.106 --> 00:04:01.131
and full mutual respect.

00:04:02.152 --> 00:04:06.293
We also call on Muslim citizens

00:04:06.293 --> 00:04:11.672
in Western countries to integrate positively and consciously into these societies,

00:04:11.672 --> 00:04:17.460
while preserving their religious and cultural identities,

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:23.554
 preventing them from being dragged behind the provocations of the Far-right politics

00:04:23.554 --> 00:04:25.722
and hateful racism.

00:04:27.185 --> 00:04:31.160
Or the polarization of groups of political Islam,

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.700
Muslim citizens must abide by the commitment and constant concern for peaceful,

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:43.632
legal and rational ways of resisting hate speech

00:04:43.632 --> 00:04:48.677
and in obtaining their legitimate rights,

00:04:48.677 --> 00:04:51.969
 following the morals of their Holy Prophet  (God's blessing and peace be upon him)

00:04:54.473 --> 00:04:58.912
We believe in all religions and prophets and respect their beliefs

00:04:58.912 --> 00:05:02.383
as we taught by our (Prophet Muhammad "pbuh")

00:05:02.383 --> 00:05:06.526
And the Holy Quran where Allah said in his dear book :

00:05:06.526 --> 00:05:09.050
In the name of Allah,
the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.665
Chapter (35) sūrat fāṭir (The Originator)
((No bearer of burdens shall bear another's burden))

00:05:11.665 --> 00:05:15.442
Because we love our prophet  Issa , our prophet  Mousa and we love our prophet  Muhammad "pbuh"

00:05:15.442 --> 00:05:20.370
So Stop insulting and abusive graphics and insulting our beliefs.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.646
Because you've legislated and shown a "few" who aren't Christian in anything.

00:05:24.646 --> 00:05:28.839
Ignorant young people don't know what to say...

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:32.400
All the respected and honorable Christians, especially .....

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.675
must stand up to this tendentious and disrespectful campaign

00:05:35.675 --> 00:05:38.729
I call on the wise Muslims and Christians

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:42.758
not to be dragged behind this corrupt current, and the spoiler for ...

00:05:42.758 --> 00:05:45.132
our fabric and our country.

00:05:45.132 --> 00:05:48.388
and the law works to address this.

00:05:48.388 --> 00:05:50.824
and the law works to address this.

00:05:50.824 --> 00:05:54.074
So it's not a tone - 
 Eat green and dry

00:05:54.074 --> 00:05:57.780
and it will not be fertile ground for every extremist ...

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.576
to offend the most honorable creation and offend the prophets of God

00:06:01.576 --> 00:06:04.216
and inject his poisons and extremism

00:06:04.216 --> 00:06:07.735
Al-Azhar and the Church have a big role to play in this,

00:06:07.735 --> 00:06:11.909
to stop irresponsible demonization from a few on both sides.

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:15.431
and the state and the law are the deterrent to anyone

00:06:15.431 --> 00:06:18.530
who sought to seduce himself to offend the prophets of God.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.467
who sought to seduce himself to offend the prophets of God.

00:06:22.467 --> 00:06:24.736
That's enough, Doctor.

00:06:24.736 --> 00:06:26.501
Shut up, man.

00:06:26.501 --> 00:06:28.321
Listen and learn.

00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:32.739
Today when the dowry is determined

00:06:32.739 --> 00:06:35.995
and parents who have daughters.

00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:39.238
and determine the levels of the dowry

00:06:39.238 --> 00:06:41.429
Listen ...

00:06:41.429 --> 00:06:44.720
I don't want you to say any Advisory opinion

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.376
and don't oppose me and shake your body

00:06:47.376 --> 00:06:50.633
Divorce on the dowry

00:06:50.633 --> 00:06:55.082
Provides the causes of life

00:06:55.082 --> 00:06:57.899
I know people who are friends of mine.

00:06:57.899 --> 00:07:00.767
Listen, for world and religion

00:07:00.767 --> 00:07:02.827
The verse is clear in the Qur'an

00:07:02.827 --> 00:07:06.702
Don't tell me a verse, don't tell me any shit.

00:07:06.702 --> 00:07:07.877
Listen , Listen

00:07:07.877 --> 00:07:12.151
I don't allow you.

00:07:12.151 --> 00:07:14.763
- how come ?
- i'm like that

00:07:14.763 --> 00:07:16.474
get out of here, boy

00:07:16.474 --> 00:07:18.383
no i will not get out of here

00:07:19.519 --> 00:07:24.958
It's normal with respect,
When you tell a story, and the Muslims say it with pride

00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.495
and unfortunately it's not bragging

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:31.288
Muhammad was married to nine women

00:07:31.596 --> 00:07:40.504
In a society that is about women 
and being with one woman or one love

00:07:40.504 --> 00:07:42.285
anyway ...

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:49.310
How can I be a child to imagine.....

00:07:49.926 --> 00:07:53.708
This commander Muhammad married nine.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.757
What's this ferocity?

00:07:56.757 --> 00:07:59.069
and what's this picture?

00:07:59.069 --> 00:08:03.848
that managed or the character that was able to combine

00:08:03.848 --> 00:08:06.664
 it is not my business it is four wife s or or or.

00:08:06.664 --> 00:08:09.663
It's going to be what?

00:08:09.663 --> 00:08:14.387
Stories 
that we're saying, which may not be unfounded sometimes or most of the time.

00:08:14.387 --> 00:08:20.467
It's the one that's causing us to look like that as a Muslims.

00:08:20.467 --> 00:08:23.475
Bombings and killings in London and elsewhere

00:08:23.475 --> 00:08:26.134
We are not healthy in our Muslim societies from the Muslims

00:08:26.134 --> 00:08:28.610
Under any slogans 
Countries destroyed by Islam

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:31.116
What do you imagine?
I'm painting any picture?

00:08:31.116 --> 00:08:33.853
Unfortunately, the nature of the situation

00:08:33.853 --> 00:08:37.323
Countries destroyed by Islam and betrayal

00:08:37.323 --> 00:08:40.130
And this foolish young man who does not

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:43.200
count on Christianity in something and his provocative comments..

00:08:44.527 --> 00:08:49.379
A Christian offends the Prophet Muhammad.

00:08:50.284 --> 00:08:56.063
The young man is named Yusuf Hani from Ismailia province

00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:02.866
Reply to a post via Facebook
Cursing the Prophet Muhammad

00:09:05.659 --> 00:09:12.594
You believe in a messenger who needs a slipper hit on his mother's brain.

00:09:20.163 --> 00:09:26.367
There were calls to judge him

00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:32.187
#Youssef_Hani_Trial 
These are the mentalities we live with 
they said that this pig is a teacher. 
So the generations that will come he teach them violence and extremism 
and cursing to the messengers 
Imagine the folding generation will come, and this pig will be their teacher. 
What are they going to do?

00:09:34.248 --> 00:09:38.003
#Youssef_Hani_Trial 
This maniac is a teacher in Ismailia. 
Cursing our holy prophet in the most horrible words 
death by hanging    
    #Youssef_Hani_Trial

00:09:41.142 --> 00:09:44.341
How long will we remain silent on the  insult of Our Master Mohammed the best of mankind 
From the dogs of the people of fire. 
This dog is in hell in the first place.
But what do we say to our master as he intercedes for us and is keen to survive every soul believer on the Day of Resurrection
Maybe God bless us and spare us people
He must be judged.

00:09:45.728 --> 00:09:48.863
God protected Egypt and Islam

00:09:48.863 --> 00:09:52.095
 and God protected the nation and its fabric.

00:09:52.095 --> 00:09:54.421
Peace be upon you and god's mercy and blessings
