00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:14.230
 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:22.798
 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.759
In the name of Allah,
The Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful.

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:33.137
I refer my message and do not deviate from this name to virtue Grand Sheikh (Sheikh -Al Azhar)

00:00:33.137 --> 00:00:40.951
I cry, grieve and feel the way muslims are, and the consequences of this pain can only be directed in my place

00:00:40.951 --> 00:00:43.765
and sorry, Imam, Sheikh al-Azhar ...

00:00:43.765 --> 00:00:47.929
I talk to you, and you know how good this great people are

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:52.542
and the big percentage of ignorance in these things and the canons of religion (strictures)

00:00:52.542 --> 00:00:56.652
It is known to you that there are several signs of

00:00:56.652 --> 00:00:59.322
( magic and a demonic possession)

00:00:59.322 --> 00:01:03.237
and in our beloved Egypt, there are those who are infected with this casualty

00:01:03.237 --> 00:01:11.327
and there's a statistic has shown that
The Egyptian people spend 10 billion a year on these matters

00:01:11.327 --> 00:01:14.875
and they don't find a safe haven for salvation

00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:17.747
So they don't get in something illegal

00:01:17.747 --> 00:01:19.438
Sidi Sheikh al-Azhar ...

00:01:19.438 --> 00:01:24.233
Why are there no specialized centers supervised by Al-Azhar?

00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:28.064
and you evaluate who's in it so that people don't fall prey

00:01:28.064 --> 00:01:31.263
to every charlatan, fortune teller or prosecutor?

00:01:31.263 --> 00:01:34.024
and that's legit in your neck

00:01:34.585 --> 00:01:38.646
 So that our women are not exposed or fielded for experiments

00:01:38.646 --> 00:01:40.805
or fall into legitimate sin

00:01:40.805 --> 00:01:43.612
and be safe under the jurisdiction of Al-Azhar

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.960
There are places and centers that are not competent, not under the jurisdiction of Al-Azhar 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.309
or It has an assessment

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:57.272
and there are no miracles in this science,

00:01:57.724 --> 00:02:01.353
but they are cargo for the purpose of earning revenue only

00:02:01.353 --> 00:02:03.639
 and secular gains without regard to humanity

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:07.345
So, who evaluates these people if they are reformed or not?

00:02:07.345 --> 00:02:10.424
Except a specialized committee from Al-Azhar

00:02:10.424 --> 00:02:14.370
Let's make it vulnerable to everyone who's been exposed to it ( for all and sundry )

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.571
The second thing is, does this science legally criminalize in our Egypt?

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:21.824
 and why is it criminalized? and It is mentioned in the Qur'an

00:02:21.824 --> 00:02:26.860
There are several universities in the world where these sciences are taught, 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.128
for example, the University of London

00:02:29.128 --> 00:02:31.193
has research laboratories called

00:02:31.193 --> 00:02:33.541
The Society for Psychical Research (SPR)

00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:38.063
and publishes a weekly newspaper showing the latest research in this field

00:02:38.063 --> 00:02:41.709
In France, the International Institute beyond the soul

00:02:43.591 --> 00:02:46.114
The German philosopher Max Deswar,

00:02:46.114 --> 00:02:48.649
 a renowned psychologist, spokes called…

00:02:49.427 --> 00:02:51.092
Parapsychology 

00:02:51.345 --> 00:02:53.822
and there's an American college of spiritual science and research, 

00:02:53.822 --> 00:02:56.424
and that's called it.

00:02:56.424 --> 00:03:01.208
If all of these countries, universities, institutes, and research laboratories

00:03:01.208 --> 00:03:03.750
 in all countries of the world 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.596
are always looking for what's new in this field which is a very important field

00:03:09.488 --> 00:03:12.826
So why don't we take the initiative under the leadership of the Imam of pride

00:03:12.826 --> 00:03:15.006
and the Chief of Imams and establish specialized centers 

00:03:15.006 --> 00:03:17.755
so that our women and daughters will not be harmed 

00:03:17.755 --> 00:03:22.063
and are vulnerable to every
 (exploited , troll and crook"con-man")

00:03:22.741 --> 00:03:26.297
 Give me your back, please

00:03:26.297 --> 00:03:29.696
Put your hand next to you, please. 

00:03:29.696 --> 00:03:33.259
Pray to Our Lord Muhammad 

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:37.932
Did God make me a reason for this girl before I knew what her story was?

00:03:37.932 --> 00:03:40.972
And before I ask, what's wrong with her? 
  Is God authorized to help her?

00:03:40.972 --> 00:03:43.643
He made me a reason?
Answer me with a sign on her arms.

00:03:53.005 --> 00:04:00.013
Raise her arms.

00:04:05.876 --> 00:04:08.687
I felt like someone was pushing me out of here. 

00:04:08.687 --> 00:04:10.782
And when I tried to get my hand down. 

00:04:10.782 --> 00:04:13.817
I felt like someone was pulling my hand up with a rope and raising my arm.

00:04:13.817 --> 00:04:18.240
The two experiments you've done with people you don't know

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.859
 or the scouts you've been through with people you don't know. 

00:04:22.859 --> 00:04:25.409
And they're from (AL-Hayah channel)'s team.

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:33.554
- Swear to God, what happened is without any interference from you. 
- I swear to God without any interference from me.

00:04:33.554 --> 00:04:40.865
I want to ask you clear questions.
Who are you talking to, you harness them, and they do all this?

00:04:40.865 --> 00:04:47.438
The truth is that it is a fabulous metaphysical thing for me
I have the right to understand, and the viewer has the right to understand what this is.

00:04:47.438 --> 00:04:50.388
I'm a very simple man, but God gave me.

00:04:50.388 --> 00:04:56.419
You've taken control of her entire body
and i've got the whole movement, and in a very strange way
and here's the question of how that happens.

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.925
- God's Mercy
He gave me this grace

00:04:59.925 --> 00:05:01.820
Do you use Jin (Ghosts), for example?

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.211
- Do you use Jin (Ghosts), for example?
- Jin is dog 
any Jin is dog, I'm not saying about them, but he's a dog.

00:05:04.211 --> 00:05:07.572
- So who did this?
- Mercy, mercy.

00:05:07.572 --> 00:05:09.827
- Did you called someone from the other side ? 
- In front of your eyes, I only took a stick of incense and prayed to the Prophet.

00:05:09.827 --> 00:05:13.154
- and I forgave God and fed God from demons.
- But you said we didn't hear. 

00:05:13.154 --> 00:05:17.294
- Who did they tell you?
- I have the same number as the girl.
Now I'm sitting with you. 

00:05:19.842 --> 00:05:22.080
- I see them and hear them. 
- Who are they?

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.539
- The mercy that God has descended upon me. 
- Are they angels?

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:29.857
I'm not going to say they're angels, and I'm not going to name them, because in a period of about seven, eight, 10 years. 

00:05:29.857 --> 00:05:37.367
When I said it is a light, mercy and angels, they accused me of being a man.
Who are you to come to you....?

00:05:38.611 --> 00:05:41.290
Why don't the state institutions cooperate?

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.878
so that everything that is not the competent centers is the one that is punished by law 

00:05:45.878 --> 00:05:48.727
and does not sing every institution in its squadron

00:05:48.727 --> 00:05:51.249
Al-Azhar forbids alcohol 

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:54.418
and tourism is promoted and the police arrest those who drink it 

00:05:54.418 --> 00:05:58.738
and this is a legitimate right and shops are selling this product

00:05:58.738 --> 00:06:04.896
 and that's a contradiction that all institutions have to meet at the same pace in this matter.

00:06:05.764 --> 00:06:09.617
Islam gives women their rights

00:06:09.617 --> 00:06:13.182
because women 
(mother, sister, wife and daughter) 

00:06:13.182 --> 00:06:15.791
and they're all crowned on the heads.

00:06:15.791 --> 00:06:19.499
 It is their right to preserve this crown 

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:23.185
from theft, pollution, touch and Demonic possession

00:06:24.325 --> 00:06:27.576
Sir, Imam, I ask God that I have reached the message… 

00:06:27.576 --> 00:06:29.593
 and I am a researcher in this field

00:06:29.593 --> 00:06:32.490
and I have seen a lot and more in it.

00:06:33.235 --> 00:06:38.752
and I have nothing to do but send the message and do the honesty, 

00:06:38.752 --> 00:06:42.502
which is now in your neck.
 Pain for our families from a bitter reality

00:06:42.502 --> 00:06:46.128
Every religion has its own specialized centers, 

00:06:46.128 --> 00:06:48.495
except Al-Azhar or Islam in general

00:06:48.495 --> 00:06:51.386
 It's not racism, but it's a religious jealousy

00:06:51.386 --> 00:06:56.244
to our Islam, our women and our children, and that's my cry to you.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.619
I know there are a lot of challenges, 

00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:03.273
but it's very important that we stand up to it.

00:07:05.047 --> 00:07:07.684
I apologize with hinging my head to God,

00:07:07.684 --> 00:07:09.695
and if there is any dreadful or miss-talk from me, 

00:07:09.695 --> 00:07:12.018
so you are the chef of imams and our respectable scholar…

00:07:12.018 --> 00:07:14.597
may Allah blessed you
may Allah saved you
