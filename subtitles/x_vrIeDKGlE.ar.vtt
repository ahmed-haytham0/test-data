00:00:11.525 --> 00:00:12.695
 

00:00:15.085 --> 00:00:16.305
 

00:00:17.075 --> 00:00:19.825
 

00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:22.635
 

00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:23.965
 

00:00:23.965 --> 00:00:26.605
Almost none of us have ever experienced (stolen) once, In traffic jams, markets or streets

00:00:26.605 --> 00:00:29.465
Almost none of us have ever experienced (stolen) once, In traffic jams, markets or streets

00:00:29.465 --> 00:00:31.945
And when we were talking to someone what happened out of the way of preaching from the situation or (the loose talk)

00:00:31.945 --> 00:00:34.685
And when we were talking to someone what happened out of the way of preaching from the situation or (the loose talk)

00:00:34.685 --> 00:00:37.355
He asks, "How did you not pay attention?"
And he's stealing you?

00:00:37.355 --> 00:00:40.835
At that time, we would reply directly to be exempt from embarrassment and say
" sleight of hand."

00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:42.935
The sentence " sleight of hand " is a slang

00:00:42.935 --> 00:00:43.865
sentence that is used here in Egypt as a term for any thief who robs us

00:00:43.865 --> 00:00:46.525
sentence that is used here in Egypt as a term for any thief who robs us

00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:48.505
Without being careful.

00:00:48.505 --> 00:00:51.720
But it is a term for everyone who works in magic

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.740
this is a very new thing honestly

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.460
I think from my point of view it is a term for mocking minds (Underestimate people’s minds.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.600
Almost none of us have heard of the two guys who have appeared on Social Media lately.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.100
on Social Media lately.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.240
(Azzam &amp; Chris El-Masri)

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.580
The two young men made too many videos and made a stir (Controversial things) on the internet

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.420
with magic or as they said it was " sleight of hand."

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.560
Before you finish the episode.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.960
It's necessary by God, to make sure people are
For a million time, I'm a sleight -hand player.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.380
confirm you if they believe you
I'm a sleight -hand player.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.700
Yes, indeed, he's a sleight -hand player.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.200
 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.360
There's no such thing as magic, people.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.320
It's all just a little sleight of hand and talent.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.780
Unfortunately, the media itself I think

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.540
was a partner in promoting of these issues
Of the way, stirring up controversy, it's nothing more than that.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.900
A lot of programs hosted them and they made episodes with them

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.800
But what attracted my attention more

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.600
A Senior Tv Presenter like

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.460
Amr El-lissy in his program "One of the People"

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.140
You password begins with number 1

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.580
And also 3 numbers are familiar so,

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.180
write treble 1

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.920
ok

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.140
3 and 1 what is the number between ?

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.260
What are you waiting for …
Write 2

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.540
2 by 3 equal what ?

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.520
6 … write 6

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.080
1, 2 , 3 , 6 ….

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.180
Look at my eyes

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.860
Write the last number 4

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.000
Its opened

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.280
Is that your password ?

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.620
Is that number is right Mustafa ?

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.060
 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.860
Or a great actor like

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.860
Ashraf Abdel-Baqi in his program "Ashraf's Coffee"

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.720
But what isn't luck, that the paper under it

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.240
Under it directly
You will find your photo while you catching the same number

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.560
Same photo

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.060
Oh no man,

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.920
5 , and you have chosen 5

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.240
What is that ?
And you have chosen 7

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.680
Same number
Show them to the Camera

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.500
What is that ?
It’s a photo of something but it's ok the same paper

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.420
Yeah,
I will make it clearly to you,  boss
Make it clearly how ?

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.860
I will play with you a tricky game right now, you thing I will be silent?
Is that Cards is full ?

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.060
explain what? Mustafa

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.640
The great God forgiven

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.180
So I will play with you a petty game , my boss ?

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.360
You haven't my children photos?

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.820
They are supposed to not leave people's minds to many questions that goes around the circle of each one of us

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.140
Unfortunately, there are no answers for it.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.600
A Young Muslim &amp; A Young Christian

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.600
And under the terms of our Eastern Arab Christian Islamic Society

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.540
So Surely al-Azhar and the church have a role and opinion in these topics

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.340
And We will have another episode with them.
 We'll talk about it later.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.220
But let us shed a little light on some of the tricks they do

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.760
For example, they have a menu for some of foods that you can choose

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.760
and they can prepare this food very easily

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.500
And you started to prepare and putting the food on the stove

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.020
I put it on the stove

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.300
Open your hand

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.920
And close with the other

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.920
Imagine that you prepare it, exactly

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.960
It's warming up

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.640
Exactly

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.620
Make it close to you and trying to smell the favor

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.320
Damn you

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.440
What have you chosen?

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.420
tell me

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.620
Potatoes

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.640
 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.860
No no no no no

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.880
No no no no no

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.540
Or, for example, they convert any soft drink to any kind of juices (or vice versa)

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.300
What color is it?

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.400
Green

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.280
Green, so it is not licorice

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.480
The licorice is a black and a little bit of yellow color, right ?

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.860
yeah

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.700
Ohh ew! , ugh!

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.700
No, no, no , no

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.560
How is that ?

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.400
You said, what you do you like?

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.180
Seven Drink

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.700
Do you like Seven Drink, right ?

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.860
Ohhhhhhhhh

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.460
Byeeee

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.180
Here, you can drink

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.360
Is this possibility as a superpower or a feature or " sleight of hand."

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.980
or whatever the name

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.100
Can for example help to solve the crises and problems that we might face

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.120
if we get a scarcity of water for example

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.200
I don't know...

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.300
Or Is it solving a hunger crisis for a poor people?

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.060
also, I don't know

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:58.820
There was a movie called ....

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.020
illusionist.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.820
is about a magical life story.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.440
In one of the scenes of the movie

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.440
this magician was trying to benefit the society

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.560
This magician offered some trick.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.040
He was trying to prove that magic could be a way to developmental agriculture very quickly.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.000
in this scene spokes of how an "orange seed" could become a big orange tree. 
  and edible.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.900
In less than a few seconds.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.160
So he linking his skill in magic to benefit the society

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.940
So, Can these guys do this?

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.280
 

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.580
 

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.160
Anyway, let's try to digest this food and beverages.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.380
And talking about "Umm Ali" (famous Egyptian Sweet Pastry Dessert
– Oriental sweet "Ali's mother"

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.620
These guys  
One of them knew the secret numbers (passwords) of any Visa card

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.380
A Tv presenter Amr Al-Laithi was very surprised

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.380
and almost he is still surprised until now

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.980
Because he didn't explain to us anything from the content he gave,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.560
but it's just a little sleight of hand.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.320
How come that’s all is just a little sleight of hand !!!!

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.520
really, I don't know

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.460
If we assume that "Ali's Mother " awake in the morning and she is surprised that

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.260
there is no credit in her visa-account

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.940
Will she be overwhelmed by the suspicion of these two young men after hearing their episode?

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.520
Or it will be a report against an unknown person

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.400
Or the police themselves automatically will suspect them

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.220
Or are these two young men angels,

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.280
Harut and Marut of the 21st-century?
(the two angels in Babylon Harut and Marut)

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.160
I don't know.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.080
Let's ignore the food .....  Let's ignore Um Ali.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.260
But Let's talk about Ali.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.540
There was a cartoon movie called 
(Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs).

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.840
This movie was telling a story of a guy who tried to benefit the people of his country

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.340
and invent a big machine for them

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.180
The mechanism of this machine to enters water on the one hand and on the other gives food and meat

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.000
 

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.580
 

00:08:46.905 --> 00:08:48.285
 

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:50.995
 

00:08:52.345 --> 00:08:54.115
 

00:08:55.865 --> 00:08:56.865
 

00:08:57.155 --> 00:08:59.705
 

00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:01.165
 

00:09:02.655 --> 00:09:03.655
 

00:09:04.175 --> 00:09:05.175
 

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.500
Let's say this kid (Ali) is now watching this Cartoon movie

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:34.860
And he knew that this Cartoon Movie turned into a reality, and the hero is REAL

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:35.640
And Suddenly,

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.020
He watches the episodes of Azzam or Chris el-Massri

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.180
and noticed the reaction of Amr Al-Laithi while he is very impressed and excited with the tricks of these two guys

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.460
and instead of dreaming of becoming an inventor and inventing that machine

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.100
He found that there is a shorter and faster way calls " sleight of hand."

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.455
So What are the inner orientations of this child?

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:52.880
I don't know.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.360
And for the psychologists in these field and their treatments we will have a special episode

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.580
I think from my point of view that the topic is v. important

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.460
And if we're joking...

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.440
It's not just a meal or a (Umm Ali) or Ali the child.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.600
I'm Tariq Mohamed.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.460
I wanted to highlight everything negative in our lives

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.400
Everyone is trying to make a mockery of our minds

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.160
A light that delivers to all minds and all cultures

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.380
And this light should be

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.800
(Perforated light)

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.600
I don't have a problem with someone specifically

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.675
But I want from everyone to give a hearty meal intellectually

00:10:19.675 --> 00:10:22.795
To get back to the whole community with the benefit

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.000
I am not coming to blame

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.305
Or words that end.

00:10:25.305 --> 00:10:28.215
And I don't speak as big words as the one that's presented in human development.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:31.940
Those people have their own characteristics and have their considerations and their affairs

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.120
But my words if it has depth

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.000
it is for intellectual development and not human development

00:10:37.005 --> 00:10:38.920
Community therapy and not community therapy

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:39.720
because I am not a therapist

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.575
I wish from you and anyone who hears this video

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.280
to listening to the next one.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.440
Because the next one, although it has no other name, Except for criticism

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.400
So It will be a constructive criticism.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.100
And I wish from every respectable person that I would criticize constructively

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.360
to be responsible for that criticism

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.340
With the replies that befits me and him

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.200
in the form of affection and respect

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.140
I don't make fun of people

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.620
I criticize things by the scientific content or the scientific material

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.320
or intellectual material or the psychological material or Occult Sciences or any something like that

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.000

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.560
with very important things and very thorny things

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.180
And really i need you to look at the next video

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:14.760
Because the next video will be very important

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.760
It's going to be a challenge.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.120
