00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.020
On Peace

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.600
Peace to you all

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.760
those who follow my channel know

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.360
that I rarely discuss politics here

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.600
but today I wanted to talk about the subject of peace

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.900
because this issue is deeper and more important

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.580
than any cheep political considerations

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.980
for it lies at the heart of religion and civilization

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.980
in Judaism and Islam

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.960
The Torah describes a conflict

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.200
that erupted between Abraham and Lot's shepherds

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.820
"And there was strife

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.440
between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.280
and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.020
Then Abram said to Lot:

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.060
Let there be no strife between you and me

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.340
and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.340
for we are kinsmen

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.260
Is not the whole land before you?

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.260
Separate yourself from me

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.120
If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.720
or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.480
So Lot chose for himself all the Jordan Valley

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.240
and Lot journeyed east

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.940
Thus they separated from each other" (Genesis 13:7-11)

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.120
Peace between two sides never comes from weakness

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.320
on the contrary

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.360
it comes from a deep and true understanding

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
of political realities

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.900
and a wish to spare lives

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.480
so today I'd like to congratulate the Arab peoples

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.360
and especially the Emirate people

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.360
on this momentous day

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.160
best wishes to all my friends across the world

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.600
and peace be upon you
