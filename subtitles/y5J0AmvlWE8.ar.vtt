00:00:01.415 --> 00:00:04.175
 

00:00:04.175 --> 00:00:05.175
 

00:00:07.095 --> 00:00:10.465
 

00:00:10.575 --> 00:00:13.445
 

00:00:13.645 --> 00:00:16.675
 

00:00:16.675 --> 00:00:18.025
 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.380
 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.260
This message came to the program from the listener Abbas Ali Ahmed Bukhari from Taif,

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.140
in which he says came to say some scientists

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.560
the year that are thrown pebbles in the day al - Adha

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:43.160
and there is talk of Jaber as saying: threw the Prophet ﷺ the Day of Sacrifice sacrificed, and threw then after The

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.780
meaning of this is that it is permissible for a pilgrim to delay the throwing of a day until after that

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.680
or delaying the whole rak'ah until the last days of Tashreeq and nothing on him

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.720
Sunnah is that on the Day of the Feast, the pilgrim will throw seven stones of the Jamrah of Aqaba

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.620
As for the rest of the days after the end of each day,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.640
he will throw the three emeralds with twenty-one pebbles, each of which will be thrown seven after the meridian.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.500
This is the project that the Prophet did.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.340
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) narrated that Jabir and others (may Allaah be pleased with him all)

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.660
said that he threw seven pebbles on the day of the feast,

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.200
then he shaved his head and distributed it to the people, peace and blessings be upon him

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:38.420
And if he delayed the throwing because of illness or crowding and threw it after the end of the day on the tenth of the grave of Aqaba

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:51.460
or the last of all to the thirteenth or twelfth day and threw in order and arranged the Jamar on what the law of God

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.700
On the day of the twelfth day of the twelfth grade in the collection of the scholars,

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:11.880
but the first and best and the year to do as the Prophet, ﷺ Fermi on the day of Eid sacrificed and if thrown at the end of the night of the Eid holiday, especially the weak

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.340
This and the rest of the Jamar is thrown after the demise, and the passage after the meridian was not easy to throw In the afternoon or afternoon

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.540
he threw him after sunset on the last day, according to the correct sayings of the scholars.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.840
He had to throw it at night for the last day

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.640
but if he threw it after sunset before sunset it was better and better, but if he did not do so

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.720
he would not throw it after sunset for the day that was absent.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.660
This sun is the right and this is the chosen

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.160
but before the end no, not thrown before

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.900
