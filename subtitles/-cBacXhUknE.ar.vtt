When the sun is wrapped up [in darkness].And when the stars fall, dispersing, And when the mountains are removed. And when full-term she-camels are neglected.

00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:38.833
And when the wild beasts are gathered. And when the seas are filled with flame. And when the souls are paired. And when the girl [who was] buried alive is asked.

00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:55.666
For what sin she was killed. And when the pages are spread [i.e., made public] . And when the sky is stripped away. And when Hellfire is set ablaze.

00:00:55.666 --> 00:01:07.232
And when Paradise is brought near,  soul will [then] know what it has brought [with it].

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:23.266
So I swear by the retreating stars - Those that run [their courses] and disappear [i.e., set] And by the night as it closes in. And by the dawn when it breathes [i.e., stirs]

00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:43.099
[That] indeed, it [i.e., the Quran] is a word [conveyed by] a noble messenger [i.e., Gabriel]  [Who is] possessed of power and with the Owner of the Throne, secure [in position], Obeyed there [in the heavens] and trustworthy.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:02:00.333
And your companion [i.e., Prophet Muhammad] is not [at all] mad. And he has already seen him [i.e., Gabriel] in the clear horizon. And he [i.e., Muhammad ] is not a withholder of [knowledge of] the unseen.

00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:31.333
And it [i.e., the Quran] is not the word of a devil, expelled [from the heavens]. So where are you going? It is not except a reminder to the worlds. For whoever wills among you to take a right course.

00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:46.133
And you do not will except that Allah wills - Lord of the worlds.

00:02:46.466 --> 00:03:01.032
When the sun is wrapped up [in darkness].And when the stars fall, dispersing, And when the mountains are removed. And when full-term she-camels are neglected.

00:03:01.033 --> 00:03:15.333
And when the wild beasts are gathered. And when the seas are filled with flame. And when the souls are paired. And when the girl [who was] buried alive is asked.
