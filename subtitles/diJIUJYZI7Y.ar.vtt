00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:02.109
Welcome to a new episode of Ripples,

00:00:02.109 --> 00:00:04.509
We’ll be talking today, once again, about * Free Will *

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.560
Since the topic was a bit controversial, I figured it deserves more than one episode

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.460
So, after the pervious Free Will episode, we’ll continue today with a brief chat.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.960
And there is also another one coming soon to go into more details.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.220
In today’s episode, we’ll discuss a video of Daniel Dennett which was shared on Ripples’ Facebook page about a month ago

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:29.340
In this video, Dennett discusses Free Will from an angle different from the one he used to take discussing the topic.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.480
So, I’d like to comment on a couple of things he mentions in this video.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.220
After hearing what he had to say, I’d like to point out a few things that, in my opinion, 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:01.560
made the thought experiment mentioned in the video invalid and inaccurate in our context regarding Free Will.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:18.260
So, the thought experiment tells us that, after this man believes that there is a microchip implanted in his brain,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:25.980
enabling the team to control all his thoughts and actions. He believed that he has no Free Will and thus became immoral. 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.400
Dennett goes on to saying that this is not different at all from what Sam Harris and other neuroscientists are doing

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.840
when they go on telling the public they have no Free Will.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.060
The inaccuracy in the implicit claim in this thought experiment regarding our context is the following:

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:52.100
The real experiment he talked about showed that when subjects read a passage about how Free Will is an illusion,

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.940
they behaved immorally (cheated) in a quiz they had to take right after reading it.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.620
But this, of course, doesn’t mean that they became immoral people for the rest of their lives.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.160
Unlike his thought experiment, in which the man becomes quite immoral 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.680
and gets himself into trouble which lead him to court eventually.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:23.160
I believe there is quite a difference between acting immorally (cheating) right after reading a passage 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.500
and becoming immoral for the rest of one’ life.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.040
If you get angry after watching a football match in which your team lost, 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.360
is different from you becoming an angry person for the rest of your life.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.040
So, this is why I believe the analogy wasn't accurate.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:52.640
And thus, the conclusions based on the thought experiment don’t seem valid to me.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:00.820
A perfect example would be his friend Sam Harris, who believes very deeply that Free Will in an illusion, 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.580
he is philosopher and neuroscientist who wrote books about the topic. 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.400
So he totally believes that Free Will is an illusion,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.480
,and yet Dennett knows that Harris is not an immoral person.  Otherwise, he wouldn't be friends with him.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.420
So, he knows that Sam is a moral person, which shows that he knows that 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:30.300
we cannot say believing that Free Will is an illusion would be a clear direct cause to making one immoral like the thought experiment implicitly suggests.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.900
And again, this makes me believe that this thought experiment does not succeed in what it was supposed to do.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.920
One more little detail regarding this thought experiment

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:51.960
If I tell you: “You and I, as humans, are a part of this natural world, which follows deterministic physical laws,

00:03:51.960 --> 00:04:02.360
and thus our actions follows deterministic laws, be it physical factors, biological, psychological, educational, etc..

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:09.140
And all those factors determine your intentions, beliefs, way of thinking, behaviors, etc..

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:23.700
And thus, our subjective feeling of having Free Will, based on which we judge each other morally, is an illusion”

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:34.860
Does the previous claim, although uneasy to hear for many of us, 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:43.040
have the same effect on the listener as: “there is this PERSON who has a device to remotely control all your actions”?

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.860
I personally don't think so!

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:58.320
In his thought experiment, the neurosurgeon told him she put a microchip in his brain and will control every move he makes.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.900
I think there is a difference between those 2 claims.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.920
But even if we didn’t agree on this point, I believe the first point is the more important on here

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.280
And it is the one that made the thought experiment and its implications be unconvincing in my opinion.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.060
And that’s it for today, 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.920
One more video regarding Free Will is coming soon. 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:20.380
In which I’ll try to clarify some things which the previous episode seemingly didn’t make clear.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.500
That’s what some of the comments seemed to suggest.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.640
So if there is something regarding the topic of Free Will you’d like me to cover in the coming episode, 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.060
please write it down in the comments below so we can hopefully discuss it together next time.
