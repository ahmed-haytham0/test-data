00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.200
When you hear these divine words of God

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.560
“And we have not sent you but as a mercy to the worlds,”

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.600
you’ll know that Islam is the religion of humanity.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.900
What is Humanity?

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.380
It is to love one another for one another,

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.440
to wish good upon mankind,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.960
mercy to all people, bring them joy,

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.100
respect and appreciate them,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.820
all this regardless of their

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.640
religion, colour, gender or class.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.900
Humanity consists of four things:

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.440
Mercy, Goodness, Love, and Beauty.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.760
Why are we saying this?

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.480
because there is a harsh kind of religious devotion

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.060
that condemns Humanity,

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.280
and there is a kind of religious devotion

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.500
that is based on bitterness and hate,

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.220
which claims to worship God

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.700
by hating non-Muslims,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.540
as well as the hatred of non-religious Muslims

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.400
and even anyone who merely opposes their ideologies.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.680
All of this is wrong,

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.660
because all of this defies the words of God

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.060
“And we have not sent you but as a mercy to the worlds.”

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.020
In simple terms, there are people

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.760
who suffer from fragility in their humanity

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.180
and they fall for using religiousness against religion.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.940
Then what is the right approach?

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.660
what’s right is that you will love not God

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.240
until you love people,

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.820
because you will love not God absolutely

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.560
until you love his creation

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.780
The love of creation derives from the love of its creator

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.220
that’s right. The prophet peace be upon him says

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.380
“None of you is truly a believer until they love for their brother

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.260
what they love for themselves”

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.940
“their brother” here includes mankind, all of mankind

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.400
and not just Muslims only, that’s right.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.120
So what should I do?
Fill your heart with love for people,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.600
all of mankind, regardless of their

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.440
religion, colour, gender or class.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.620
Make a decision today to start loving people.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.500
Islam is the religion of humanity.
