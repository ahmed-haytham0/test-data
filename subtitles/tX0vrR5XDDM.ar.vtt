00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.380
Once Upon A Time in Hollywood

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.440
which is set in Los Angeles in 1969

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.660
is Quentin Tarantino’s latest movie.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.440
It was inspired by the veteran director’s memories when he was 6 years old

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.860
prompting some commentators to suggest that it was his most personal movie.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.120
 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.695
 

00:00:22.695 --> 00:00:25.775
 

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:28.555
 

00:00:28.555 --> 00:00:29.555
 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.160
 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.560
Indeed, Tarantino consistently uses modern classic genre in telling his stories

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.175
including western, spaghetti western, neo noir

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.740
dark comedy, action, martial art, crime and horror

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.160
Often, He concocts them in one film, then colors them with his own style, creating a genre of his own

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.800
which was first manifested in his debut, Reservoir Dogs in 1992

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.580
when he was 28 years old.

00:01:00.585 --> 00:01:03.315
 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.460
 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.540
Reservoir Dogs was not merely a heist movie, but rather a new cinematic phenomenon

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.900
The Tarantino phenomenon, which relied on nonlinear storytelling

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.180
fast-paced firey dialogue

00:01:19.185 --> 00:01:22.235
stylized violence colored with humor

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.480
and pop culture references and music scores from the 60s and 70’s songs.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.420
But the film that catapulted Tarantino to the pinnacle of Hollywood’s power and international fame was Pulp Fiction

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.900
which was directed in 1994

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.320
Pulp Fiction is a crime film

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.675
in which Tarantino demolished mainstream cinema rules

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.840
by using his cinematic style and nonlinear narrative in telling overlapping stories of gangsters

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.300
and small-time criminals

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.760
The film was an enormous commercial and critical success

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.560
It snatched Cannes’ Palm D’or, followed by 7 Oscar nomination and one win

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.320
It’s widely considered one of the greatest films ever, has been a source of inspiration to subsequent movies.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.760
In 1997

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.600
Tarantino used blacksploitation in making Jackie Brown

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.920
Thereafter, he mixed martial art, Western spaghetti and Italian horror genres in Kill Bill 1 &amp; 2.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.220
He continues to use Western in Inglorious Bastards

00:02:30.225 --> 00:02:32.895
which is set in WWIIand

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.660
and Django Unchained

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.480
which deals with slavery in the antebellum South,  and The Hateful Eight

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.580
a tale of 8 strangers who battle each other to death.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.200
 

00:02:49.255 --> 00:02:52.655
 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.700
 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.700
Tarantino began his career as an actor and screenwriter

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.720
In early 90’s, he sold his screenplays, True Romance and Natural Born Killer

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.640
to Hollywood studios, and invested the money in making Reservoir Dogs.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.040
Hence, the scripts are always the strongest component in his movies

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.300
gaining him numerous awards, including two Oscars

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.420
one for Pulp Fiction and the other for Django Unchained.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.260
 

00:03:29.265 --> 00:03:32.245
 

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:35.375
 

00:03:35.375 --> 00:03:38.365
 

00:03:38.365 --> 00:03:41.375
 

00:03:41.375 --> 00:03:44.115
 

00:03:44.345 --> 00:03:47.435
 

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:50.575
 

00:03:50.575 --> 00:03:53.415
 

00:03:53.415 --> 00:03:55.975
 

00:03:55.975 --> 00:03:58.335
 

00:03:58.335 --> 00:04:00.555
 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.375
 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.400
After completing writing the film script, Tarantino cast some of Hollywood’s biggest stars in it

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.180
like Leonardo Dicaprio, who starred in Django Unchained

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.720
and Brad Pitt, who starred in Inglorious Bastards.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.000
Both returned to star in Once Upon A Time In Hollywood.

00:04:21.165 --> 00:04:22.975
 

00:04:22.975 --> 00:04:25.065
 

00:04:25.065 --> 00:04:26.575
 

00:04:26.575 --> 00:04:29.105
 

00:04:29.105 --> 00:04:32.555
 

00:04:33.045 --> 00:04:35.825
 

00:04:35.825 --> 00:04:38.595
 

00:04:38.705 --> 00:04:41.605
 

00:04:41.605 --> 00:04:44.880
 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.100
Tarantino’s movies are always underpinned by a battle between good and evil

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.660
and end with brutal punishment of the bad guys

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.820
In Django Unchained, the slave fights his white owners and drowns them in their own blood.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.900
In Inglorious Basterds

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:09.580
Jewish American soldiers wage war against the Nazis before they burn Hitler and his commanders in a theatre.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.260
and in kill bill

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.000
a bride revenged on her husband's team of assassins who after he tried to kill her

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.180
And in his last film, Once Upon A Time in Hollywood

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.800
evil is personified by the hippy Charles Manson family

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.320
who committed brutal murders in 1969 in Los Angeles.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.240
 

00:05:28.245 --> 00:05:30.095
 

00:05:30.095 --> 00:05:32.025
 

00:05:32.025 --> 00:05:34.565
 

00:05:34.565 --> 00:05:36.925
 

00:05:36.925 --> 00:05:39.485
 

00:05:39.855 --> 00:05:42.735
 

00:05:42.735 --> 00:05:45.765
 

00:05:45.765 --> 00:05:48.175
 

00:05:48.175 --> 00:05:51.185
 

00:05:51.185 --> 00:05:54.145
 

00:05:54.625 --> 00:05:58.005
 

00:05:58.005 --> 00:06:01.105
 

00:06:01.105 --> 00:06:02.445
 

00:06:02.955 --> 00:06:05.495
 

00:06:05.495 --> 00:06:08.535
 

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:11.095
 

00:06:11.095 --> 00:06:13.035
 

00:06:13.035 --> 00:06:14.845
 

00:06:15.405 --> 00:06:17.825
 

00:06:18.045 --> 00:06:19.625
 

00:06:19.625 --> 00:06:22.175
 

00:06:22.175 --> 00:06:25.105
 

00:06:25.105 --> 00:06:28.135
 

00:06:28.135 --> 00:06:30.935
 

00:06:30.935 --> 00:06:33.775
 

00:06:33.895 --> 00:06:36.955
 

00:06:36.955 --> 00:06:39.435
 

00:06:40.215 --> 00:06:42.155
 

00:06:42.155 --> 00:06:45.015
 

00:06:45.015 --> 00:06:47.485
 

00:06:47.485 --> 00:06:50.375
 

00:06:50.375 --> 00:06:52.505
 

00:06:52.505 --> 00:06:55.545
 

00:06:55.545 --> 00:06:58.445
 

00:06:58.445 --> 00:07:00.455
 

00:07:00.455 --> 00:07:02.835
 

00:07:02.835 --> 00:07:04.945
 

00:07:04.945 --> 00:07:08.120
 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.980
Tarantino’s movies often suffered from a long run

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.040
which ranges between 2-3 hours

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.300
that's because he writes long screenplays

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:26.580
And when he failed to shorten Kill Bill, which was 4 hours long, he divided it to two volumes

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.560
Yet, his movies hardly bore the audience.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.980
 

00:07:35.935 --> 00:07:37.945
 

00:07:38.295 --> 00:07:40.995
 

00:07:40.995 --> 00:07:43.995
 

00:07:43.995 --> 00:07:47.095
 

00:07:47.455 --> 00:07:50.455
 

00:07:50.455 --> 00:07:53.295
 

00:07:53.295 --> 00:07:54.595
 

00:07:54.915 --> 00:07:56.945
 

00:07:56.945 --> 00:08:00.105
 

00:08:00.145 --> 00:08:03.345
 

00:08:03.345 --> 00:08:06.075
 

00:08:06.075 --> 00:08:09.065
 

00:08:09.065 --> 00:08:11.105
 

00:08:11.415 --> 00:08:13.595
 

00:08:13.595 --> 00:08:16.265
 

00:08:16.265 --> 00:08:19.695
 

00:08:20.365 --> 00:08:23.235
 

00:08:23.235 --> 00:08:25.625
 

00:08:25.625 --> 00:08:28.575
 

00:08:28.575 --> 00:08:31.445
 

00:08:31.755 --> 00:08:33.955
 

00:08:33.955 --> 00:08:36.155
 

00:08:36.155 --> 00:08:38.165
 

00:08:38.495 --> 00:08:41.575
 

00:08:41.575 --> 00:08:44.655
 

00:08:44.655 --> 00:08:47.825
 

00:08:47.825 --> 00:08:50.405
 

00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:53.165
 

00:08:53.165 --> 00:08:54.915
 

00:08:55.315 --> 00:08:58.245
 

00:08:58.245 --> 00:09:00.775
 

00:09:00.775 --> 00:09:04.005
 

00:09:04.005 --> 00:09:06.145
 

00:09:06.145 --> 00:09:09.355
 

00:09:09.355 --> 00:09:11.475
 

00:09:11.475 --> 00:09:14.225
 

00:09:14.225 --> 00:09:16.255
 

00:09:16.255 --> 00:09:19.265
 

00:09:19.265 --> 00:09:21.945
 

00:09:22.475 --> 00:09:24.125
 

00:09:24.125 --> 00:09:25.825
 

00:09:25.825 --> 00:09:28.415
 

00:09:28.885 --> 00:09:31.835
 

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.715
 

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.580
The release of one of the 56-year-old actor movies

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.680
often ignites a storm of anticipation among his fans and commentator about his next project

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.900
This time, the level of anticipation is unprecedented

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:47.460
because his movie, the tenth, will be his last

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.660
But it seems that it won’t be his last directing

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.780
he will simply move to a new medium: Streaming TV.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:56.540
