00:00:13.022 --> 00:00:15.022
A story in Egyptian oral heritage

00:00:15.022 --> 00:00:17.335
Says that Shajarat Al-Dur

00:00:17.335 --> 00:00:19.866
After she was overthrown by Ezzeddin Aybak

00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:24.778
Was revolted, and decided to go get her revenge She talked to him

00:00:24.778 --> 00:00:27.733
She seduced him into meeting her in the citadel

00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:30.145
He went to meet her, but never returned.

00:00:30.145 --> 00:00:32.672
Aybak's Mamluks suspected her

00:00:32.672 --> 00:00:35.674
And did not believe her when she told them he died naturally

00:00:35.674 --> 00:00:37.485
So they took her to his wife

00:00:37.485 --> 00:00:39.656
whose name was Om Ali

00:00:39.656 --> 00:00:43.544
Om Ali decided to execute her instantly

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:47.263
And commanded that her servants would beat Shajarat Al-Durr with their [wooden] shoes until they killed her

00:00:47.263 --> 00:00:50.551
It is told that right then Om Ali commanded

00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:54.476
that the best meal be prepared to celebrate the loss of Shajarat Al-Durr

00:00:54.476 --> 00:00:56.833
The dessert was named after her

00:00:56.833 --> 00:00:58.833
Om Ali

00:01:36.878 --> 00:01:39.334
The dessert was made out of bread crisps, milk, and sugar

00:01:39.334 --> 00:01:42.029
A mixture that is present in many cultures

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:44.816
Like bread pudding in the UK

00:01:44.816 --> 00:01:48.280
And French toast in the US

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.404
And today we add raisins and cinnamon to the mix

00:01:51.404 --> 00:01:53.331
and serve it in a warm tajine

00:01:53.331 --> 00:01:55.525
to sweeten any cold winter night

00:01:55.525 --> 00:01:57.693
Where's the best Om Ali in Egypt?

00:01:57.693 --> 00:02:04.491
