00:00:12.827 --> 00:00:14.827
Bread means life. [The word for bread in Arabic is also a word for life].

00:00:14.827 --> 00:00:16.827
And liberty, security and independence. 

00:00:17.573 --> 00:00:21.615
And it is of the social, political and economic priorities

00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:24.252
in our culture since Pharaonic times

00:00:24.252 --> 00:00:27.139
Its price was always correspondent to our economy

00:00:27.139 --> 00:00:31.904
It has always been the first signifier of crisis or thrive

00:00:31.904 --> 00:00:36.168
For example, in 1977, Cairo was shaken by what's referred to as the Bread Intifada

00:00:36.168 --> 00:00:40.187
Which happened after a 50% spike in the price of bread

00:00:40.187 --> 00:00:43.254
It also makes sense that the 25 January revolution in 2011

00:00:43.254 --> 00:00:46.442
Raised the slogan "Bread, Liberty, and Social Justice"

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.995
The pharaohs baked it out of emmer wheat

00:01:31.995 --> 00:01:35.306
Its closest living relative is Shamsi [pertaining to the sun] bread

00:01:35.306 --> 00:01:38.009
Which is fermented and baked in sunlight

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.245
And there is evidence that it was the food of pyramid builders

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.086
And that bread bakeries were a component of the infrastructure for this ancient Egyptian megaproject

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.111
During Ottoman times

00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:54.052
The government subsidized bakeries, and placed quality control laws on bread production

00:01:54.052 --> 00:01:56.691
Which was sold to the masses at the time

00:01:56.691 --> 00:01:58.720
Which led to a boom for bakeries

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.828
At the time, bakers organized, and had a syndicate and a marketplace

00:02:01.828 --> 00:02:04.302
Shamsi bread is still present in Upper Egypt

00:02:04.302 --> 00:02:06.452
But it is endangered

00:02:06.452 --> 00:02:08.480
Because it takes time to ferment and bake

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.537
and mechanizing its production is next to impossible

00:02:10.537 --> 00:02:12.905
Unlike contemporary Baladi [pertaining to the country] bread

00:02:12.905 --> 00:02:16.042
Which is baked fast and high on an assembly lline

00:02:16.042 --> 00:02:18.206
and is sold from government funded bakeries in massive quantities every day

00:02:18.206 --> 00:02:23.109
And Bahari [pertaining to the sea] bread, which is baked in Alexandria, the Delta, and the North Coast

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:25.056
Which looks like Shami [pertaining to the Levant]

00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:28.160
Bread is present in many Egyptian recipes

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.039
Like Fatta and Hawawshi

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:31.602
And it's a staple of Egyptian dining tables

00:02:31.602 --> 00:02:34.194
We use it to dip Molokheya

00:02:34.194 --> 00:02:36.745
or make foul and taameya sandwiches

00:02:36.745 --> 00:02:38.647
Our love for it is not a choice

00:02:38.647 --> 00:02:39.734
It is dependency

00:02:39.734 --> 00:02:41.944
Because it's cheap, nutritious, and widely available

00:02:41.944 --> 00:02:44.473
but especially great when it's warm and fresh

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.609
What is the weirdest thing you've eaten in a sandwich?

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:56.497
