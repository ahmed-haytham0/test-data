00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.025
And when I am ill, it is He who cures me

00:00:05.025 --> 00:00:11.665
And who will cause me to die and then bring me to life

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:23.160
And who I aspire that He will forgive me my sin on the Day of Recompense."

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:34.520
No! When the soul has reached the collar bones and it is said, "Who will cure [him]?"

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:42.555
And the dying one is certain that it is the [time of] separation

00:00:42.555 --> 00:00:49.275
And the leg is wound about the leg,

00:00:49.275 --> 00:00:56.595
To your Lord, that Day, will be the procession.

00:00:56.595 --> 00:01:00.735
And the disbeliever had not believed, nor had he prayed.

00:01:00.735 --> 00:01:05.895
But [instead], he denied and turned away.

00:01:05.895 --> 00:01:13.145
And then he went to his people, swaggering [in pride].

00:01:13.145 --> 00:01:16.615
Woe to you, and woe!

00:01:16.615 --> 00:01:21.655
Then woe to you, and woe!

00:01:21.655 --> 00:01:27.965
Does man think that he will be left neglected?

00:01:27.965 --> 00:01:35.285
Had he not been a sperm from semen emitted?

00:01:35.285 --> 00:01:41.945
Then he was a clinging clot, and [ Allah ] created [his form] and proportioned [him]

00:01:41.945 --> 00:01:48.805
And made of him two mates, the male and the female.

00:01:48.805 --> 00:01:53.145
Is not that [Creator] Able

00:01:53.145 --> 00:02:04.740
Is not that [Creator] Able to give life to the dead?

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.360
I swear by the Day of Resurrection

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.660
And I swear by the reproaching soul [to the certainty of resurrection].

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.800
Does man think that We will not assemble his bones?

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:36.315
Yes. [We are] Able [even] to proportion his fingertips.

00:02:36.315 --> 00:02:42.285
But man desires to continue in sin.

00:02:42.285 --> 00:02:47.325
He asks, "When is the Day of Resurrection?"

00:02:47.325 --> 00:02:50.475
So when vision is dazzled

00:02:50.475 --> 00:02:53.100
And the moon darkens

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.960
And the sun and the moon are joined,

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:03.460
Man will say on that Day, "Where is the [place of] escape?"

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.000
No! There is no refuge.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.040
To your Lord, that Day, is the [place of] permanence.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:19.175
Man will be informed that Day of what he sent ahead and kept back.

00:03:19.175 --> 00:03:25.395
Rather, man, against himself, will be a witness,

00:03:25.395 --> 00:03:29.295
Even if he presents his excuses.

00:03:29.295 --> 00:03:35.225
Move not your tongue with it, [O Muhammad], to hasten with recitation of the Qur'an.

00:03:35.225 --> 00:03:41.405
Indeed, upon Us is its collection [in your heart] and [to make possible] its recitation.

00:03:41.405 --> 00:03:46.575
So when We have recited it [through Gabriel], then follow its recitation.

00:03:46.575 --> 00:03:54.025
Then upon Us is its clarification [to you].

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:58.685
No! But you love the immediate

00:03:58.685 --> 00:04:01.995
And leave the Hereafter.

00:04:01.995 --> 00:04:07.995
[Some] faces, that Day, will be radiant,

00:04:07.995 --> 00:04:11.805
Looking at their Lord.

00:04:11.805 --> 00:04:17.820
And [some] faces, that Day, will be contorted,

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.720
Expecting that there will be done to them [something] backbreaking.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:30.285
No! When the soul has reached the collar bones

00:04:30.285 --> 00:04:36.335
And it is said, "Who will cure [him]?"

00:04:36.335 --> 00:04:43.480
And the dying one is certain that it is the [time of] separation

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:54.840
No! When the soul has reached the collar bones and it is said, "Who will cure [him]?"

00:04:54.855 --> 00:05:02.880
And the dying one is certain that it is the [time of] separation

00:05:02.895 --> 00:05:09.625
And the leg is wound about the leg,

00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:16.935
To your Lord, that Day, will be the procession.

00:05:16.935 --> 00:05:21.075
And the disbeliever had not believed, nor had he prayed.

00:05:21.075 --> 00:05:26.235
But [instead], he denied and turned away.

00:05:26.235 --> 00:05:33.525
And then he went to his people, swaggering [in pride].

00:05:33.525 --> 00:05:36.965
Woe to you, and woe!

00:05:36.965 --> 00:05:42.105
Then woe to you, and woe!

00:05:42.105 --> 00:05:48.315
Does man think that he will be left neglected?

00:05:48.315 --> 00:05:55.620
Had he not been a sperm from semen emitted?

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:02.440
Then he was a clinging clot, and [ Allah ] created [his form] and proportioned [him]

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:09.220
And made of him two mates, the male and the female.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.500
Is not that [Creator] Able

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:25.215
Is not that [Creator] Able to give life to the dead?

00:06:25.215 --> 00:06:29.600
Has there reached you the report of the Overwhelming [event]?

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.360
[Some] faces, that Day, will be humbled,

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.245
Working [hard] and exhausted.

00:06:38.245 --> 00:06:42.175
They will [enter to] burn in an intensely hot Fire.

00:06:42.175 --> 00:06:46.600
They will be given drink from a boiling spring.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:54.060
For them there will be no food except from a poisonous, thorny plant

00:06:54.060 --> 00:07:01.060
Which neither nourishes nor avails against hunger.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:07.095
[Other] faces, that Day, will show pleasure.

00:07:07.095 --> 00:07:10.720
With their effort [they are] satisfied

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.020
In an elevated garden,

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:19.100
Wherein they will hear no unsuitable speech.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.260
Within it is a flowing spring.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.735
Within it are couches raised high

00:07:27.735 --> 00:07:32.275
And cups put in place

00:07:32.275 --> 00:07:35.820
And cushions lined up

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:40.140
And carpets spread around.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:46.745
Then do they not look at the camels - how they are created?

00:07:46.745 --> 00:07:52.175
And at the sky - how it is raised?

00:07:52.175 --> 00:07:56.085
And at the mountains - how they are erected?

00:07:56.085 --> 00:08:00.645
And at the earth - how it is spread out?

00:08:00.645 --> 00:08:07.995
So remind, [O Muhammad]; you are only a reminder.

00:08:07.995 --> 00:08:12.595
You are not over them a controller.

00:08:12.595 --> 00:08:17.740
However, he who turns away and disbelieves -

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:23.620
Then Allah will punish him with the greatest punishment.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:29.640
Indeed, to Us is their return.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:36.520
Then indeed, upon Us is their account.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:47.880
No! When the soul has reached the collar bones and it is said, "Who will cure [him]?"

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:56.000
And the dying one is certain that it is the [time of] separation

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.520
And the leg is wound about the leg,
