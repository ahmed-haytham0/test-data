00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.023
I'm confessingâ€¦ Admit to you being smart

00:00:28.023 --> 00:00:32.913
I admit you tried to put the poison and make the medicine out of it.

00:00:32.913 --> 00:00:36.803
Chris ... Chris, you've taken the devil's role

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:40.310
And the devil owned you and you embraced him with all containment

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.700
Your criticism is probably difficult for the public, and you call it is a sleight of hand and you call it ...

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.495
no no no, there is something wrong

00:00:47.922 --> 00:00:49.922
i swear it's a trick

00:00:49.922 --> 00:00:51.154
no no no, how it's just a trick? you are a up normal man ..

00:00:51.154 --> 00:00:52.709
i swear it's a trick ...

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.747
hey, people    It's all a gift and an art

00:00:55.747 --> 00:00:57.492
 art called the art of deception, not magic.

00:00:57.972 --> 00:01:00.646
I raise the hat for that justification

00:01:00.646 --> 00:01:04.195
But maybe from my point of view and the views of many people you are Magician

00:01:04.195 --> 00:01:07.623
And not only a magician, you are also bold and libertine

00:01:07.623 --> 00:01:12.849
And one of the greatest things that you got yourself into is that you raise the dead with a pigeon

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:15.407
And you told the people this is not magic this is a sleight of hand

00:01:15.407 --> 00:01:17.118
Today I'm going to a birdseller ...

00:01:17.118 --> 00:01:20.167
and I'll have a pigeon that shows she's dead. 
But this head is made of plastic.

00:01:20.167 --> 00:01:22.452
Let's see how he reacts when I ask him for treatment.

00:01:22.452 --> 00:01:25.458
I want a cure for this pigeon.

00:01:25.458 --> 00:01:31.922
There's no cure for this condition.

00:01:31.922 --> 00:01:37.393
Do you have the cure?
 Can you do a medical check-up on her?

00:01:37.393 --> 00:01:40.376
rest in peace (RIP)

00:01:40.376 --> 00:01:43.245
there is no a cure for her ... she is dead

00:01:43.245 --> 00:01:46.158
come in here beside me

00:01:46.158 --> 00:01:50.058
there is no a cure ???? yeah

00:01:56.781 --> 00:02:00.768
you said there is no a cure 

00:02:00.768 --> 00:02:02.768
come closer

00:02:04.768 --> 00:02:06.768
what is that ?

00:02:15.603 --> 00:02:24.247
i have a lot of dead pigeons inside ,  Stored in the fridge

00:02:33.266 --> 00:02:42.031
it is just a trick, it was a plastic head

00:02:44.292 --> 00:02:53.091
she woke up well right ?

00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:58.511
- Did you slaughter her a long time ago?
- yeah for a long time ago

00:03:02.737 --> 00:03:10.214
so you said that you have alot of dead pigeons inside? i can't do that, it's all just a trick 

00:03:10.214 --> 00:03:13.406
thank's for watching, and remember that my goal to make you happy

00:03:13.406 --> 00:03:16.459
and for sure I hid the pigeon's head somehow.

00:03:20.204 --> 00:03:23.329
The easiest thing for you is to poison the honey ...

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.260
 you eat it to people as honey, but it's deadly for the minds

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.334
so We can say, that you are...             
  (Jesus the Messenger of modern era)

00:03:30.334 --> 00:03:32.331
Under the provisions that you are a Christian man ...

00:03:32.331 --> 00:03:36.234
 is it appropriate for you as a Christian to take the role of Our Lord Jesus Christ

00:03:36.234 --> 00:03:39.124
and if Our Prophet Jesus lived and saw you doing this 

00:03:39.124 --> 00:03:43.280
he would say to you that you are a devout Christian or are you the good son ?

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.000
Don't laugh at people

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.562
If you sold yourself to the devil and the devil was your god ... so, Don't make the Devil a god of people either.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:53.846
Do what you want... worship the devil to do all what you want,  

00:03:53.846 --> 00:03:58.673
charming the eyes of the people, charm their vision and making a Simiyya,  and in the end you say this is a sleight of hand

00:03:58.673 --> 00:04:02.297
Enough to mislead ... are you afraid of legal accountability?

00:04:02.297 --> 00:04:06.125
afraid that you will confess to people that you worship the devil ? do not do.

00:04:06.125 --> 00:04:09.762
Be a man and tell people that this is magic and that you are a magician

00:04:09.762 --> 00:04:13.751
and scored in the law and say I sold God and bought the devil

00:04:13.751 --> 00:04:16.037
Be careful with the devil he is Exposed and Libertine 

00:04:16.037 --> 00:04:18.037
He has boldly in exposing things to himself.

00:04:18.037 --> 00:04:21.085
So  be on your boyfriend's religion, Don't decorate the picture.

00:04:21.085 --> 00:04:25.744
Don't frame the religion and you're against it.
 Or between honesty and you are a liar

00:04:25.744 --> 00:04:29.853
 You lie to people all the time and say I am not a magician this is a sleight of hand

00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:36.288
Mercy to us,  so have mercy on our children, have mercy on our religion, have mercy on our society from putting religion in everything

00:04:36.288 --> 00:04:41.245
If WE take the opinion of a priest he will tell you that you are a magician and if WE take the opinion of sheikh he will tell you that you are a magician also

00:04:41.245 --> 00:04:44.994
Even if there is a magician who worships satan, Does he will doing good?  for sure not

00:04:44.994 --> 00:04:47.189
 There is no devil doing good

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:50.622
You say there is Ramadan (Holy month for Muslims)  I make charity with money

00:04:50.622 --> 00:04:53.984
 Charity to people with t-shirts , make a lantern for Ramadan,   You mix things up.

00:04:53.984 --> 00:04:56.059
 Of course there is no devil doing good

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:57.508
How does he fly like that?

00:04:57.508 --> 00:04:59.112
We saw you standing on the air.

00:04:59.112 --> 00:05:00.700
There was a ladder, but you were standing on the air.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.890
I'm Chris Masri. 
                   Ramadan Karim and                                
    on the occasion of Ramadan 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.895
I thought of a new idea.
To put a ladder and put a lantern Ramadan
And anyone who passes, I'm going to throw a ladder on the floor.

00:05:07.895 --> 00:05:10.467
Let's see how they react when they see me standing in the air.
Let's roll

00:05:47.153 --> 00:05:53.604
Now I have a gift with a t-shirt. 
And I'm going to convince anyone that he's the magician and that he'll know how to get a T-shirt.

00:06:30.961 --> 00:06:35.069
Go back to yourself.  Repentance to God... Admit it

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:37.483
 Life is short and fame is mortal.

00:06:37.483 --> 00:06:42.373
And many people like you a million times and a million times better than you

00:06:42.373 --> 00:06:44.788
 and they were more famous than you  and they're in the dirt.

00:06:44.788 --> 00:06:48.053
I wonder where they are. God knows,       
  I don't know.

00:06:48.053 --> 00:06:49.687
You are the one who will admit

00:06:49.687 --> 00:06:53.350
I am motivated not by you or i advise you I am motivated 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.971
by our society about our children for a whole generation

00:06:55.971 --> 00:06:58.057
Mercy to us,   

00:06:58.057 --> 00:07:01.005
 we are an Arabian Muslim Christian society 

00:07:01.005 --> 00:07:05.646
We are one fabric, a fabric that cant be in it, a worn-out piece

00:07:05.646 --> 00:07:09.428
Either it is removed or changed or the dress will be imbecable

00:07:09.428 --> 00:07:11.820
 and there are many holes in it

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.293
You and Azzam and everyone who's Chris and Azzam.

00:07:15.293 --> 00:07:17.227
 Last speech ...

00:07:17.227 --> 00:07:20.421
The right of reply is guaranteed 

00:07:20.421 --> 00:07:24.821
and I call for your audience of minds not people who are happy to eat beans    
  Bye
