00:00:00.215 --> 00:00:03.185
in the name of of the God the Merciful
Praise be to God

00:00:03.185 --> 00:00:05.185
and may blessings and peace be upon our master, Messenger of God

00:00:05.185 --> 00:00:08.100
his family, companions and those who followed him

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.100
With your questions that were received in this holy month of Ramadan

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.100
Someone asks:

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.100
I ask about terms that I want to differentiate:

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.600
tahajjud

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.100
Tarawih

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.900
Night prayer

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.900
What is the difference between these words?

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.900
What is the best thing that I worship allah with it in the nights of Ramadan?

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.900
These words are intertwined

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:50.900
The word “night prayer” means that you stand for God after the Isha prayer

00:00:50.900 --> 00:01:00.900
All that you prayed after Isha prayer is one of the night prayers until Fajr

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.900
so whatever happens at this time we call the night prayer.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:15.900
The Companions used to pray as the Messenger was praying

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:24.900
and the Messenger in Ramadan or in others did not exceed 11 Kneel or 13

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.200
he did not exceed this during Ramadan or not in Ramadan.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:42.200
But Omar bin Al-Khattab gathered the companions together on 20

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:56.160
the people of Makkah prayed these 20 and ranged around the Kaaba between all four rakats

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.440
so the people of Medina heard this, so they made the place of each raft of 4 rak'ahs

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:11.400
they became in the era of Imam Malik became 36 rak'ahs

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:21.400
So, the increase in goodness, and the proliferation of worship

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.400
are the actions of the Messenger of God,

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.400
the rightly guided caliphs and the righteous predecessors.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.400
When that was the case...

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.400
muslims prayed 20 rak'ahs, which are called Taraweeh

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.400
and we must pray two by two

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:55.900
So, people called what is called after that from the good and from the increase: the Tahajjud prayer

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.100
so there became a common term among Muslims that Taraweeh is called on the 20 rak'ahs

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.100
then what is prayed after that in the midst of the night until fajr,

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.100
it is called Tahajjud,

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.100
and both are a component of the night prayer

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.100
A person should worship allah with his energy

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.500
I mean, within the limits of his energy

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.500
and he does not have to load himself what cannot be tolerated

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.500
because God does not tire until you get bored as the Messenger of God guides us

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.500
This is the best case wherever you find your heart.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.500
To another meeting

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.500
may God bless you and peace and God's mercy and blessings be upon you.
