00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.020
And I advice

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.500
everyone to whom my statement reaches

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.620
I advice them to take care of the book of Allah

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.220
because the book of Allah contains guidance and light

00:00:11.095 --> 00:00:12.635
and it's the root of all goodness

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.360
Indeed, this Qur'an guides to that which is most suitable (17:09)

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.060
Say, "It is, for those who believe, a guidance and cure." (41:44)

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.480
Exalted is He, said,

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.780
And We have sent down to you the Book as clarification for all things

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.820
and as guidance and mercy and good tidings for the Muslims. (16:89)

00:00:27.775 --> 00:00:29.105
So it is an obligation upon the people of knowledge

00:00:29.615 --> 00:00:30.835
and the students of knowledge

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.400
and those who recite the book of Allah either from memory or reading

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.540
to give great concern to this tremendous book

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.360
and devote his entire heart to it

00:00:40.805 --> 00:00:43.745
learning it, contemplating upon it, and understanding it

00:00:43.745 --> 00:00:45.085
in the appropriate times

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:48.995
in his night and day times and in his free time

00:00:49.575 --> 00:00:51.465
so he would benefit from the speech of his Lord

00:00:51.965 --> 00:00:53.615
and so that he knows his Lord

00:00:53.945 --> 00:00:55.025
and so that he acts upon it

00:00:55.915 --> 00:00:57.355
Exalted is He, said, [This is] a blessed Book

00:00:58.195 --> 00:01:00.125
which We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad],

00:01:00.545 --> 00:01:02.385
that they might reflect upon its verses

00:01:02.755 --> 00:01:04.375
and that those of understanding would be reminded. (38:29)

00:01:05.135 --> 00:01:06.295
Exalted is He, also said,

00:01:06.685 --> 00:01:08.415
Then do they not reflect upon the Qur'an,

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.360
or are there locks upon [their] hearts? (47:24)

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.800
So it is upon the Muslims

00:01:14.545 --> 00:01:17.395
in general and the scholars specifically

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.880
and the students of knowledge

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.480
to give great concern to the glorious Qur'an

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.580
complete and special care,

00:01:23.895 --> 00:01:26.515
contemplating, and understanding

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.460
and increasing in its recitation

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.720
and searching for benefits,

00:01:31.265 --> 00:01:32.265
then acting upon it.

00:01:33.345 --> 00:01:34.755
And if you have an issue

00:01:35.585 --> 00:01:37.145
return it to a scholar

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.720
or a colleague

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.900
and to search with him concerning the issue

00:01:44.135 --> 00:01:46.585
and go back to the well-known books of Tafseer

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.460
for in them is a lot of good

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.880
Like Ibn Jarir, Al Baghawi, Ibn Kathir, and others

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.500
go back to them concerning his issue

00:01:53.975 --> 00:01:55.275
and benefit from

00:01:55.735 --> 00:01:56.955
the issue

00:01:57.315 --> 00:01:58.455
and go back to the evidences

00:01:58.825 --> 00:02:01.335
from the ahadith if the affair of the verse isn't clear

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.300
and not be negligent

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.180
and

00:02:08.835 --> 00:02:11.255
the tools he needs is available

00:02:11.605 --> 00:02:14.525
from the books of Al Gharib, books of Al Lughah

00:02:14.525 --> 00:02:16.580
books of hadith, Usool al fiqh

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.080
Mustalah Al Hadith, and other than that that the student of knowledge will need.

00:02:22.345 --> 00:02:24.635
And he who recites the Qur'an and is not a scholar

00:02:24.955 --> 00:02:28.365
Allah will make it easy for him if he contemplates and understands it

00:02:28.755 --> 00:02:30.195
and in that as well,

00:02:30.505 --> 00:02:33.785
softening of his heart and increase in his eman

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:36.685
and reminding of the Hereafter and the rights of Allah

00:02:36.935 --> 00:02:39.895
thus he increases in knowledge, guidance, and Taqwa

00:02:39.895 --> 00:02:41.325
and he wouldn't be deprived of knowledge

00:02:41.675 --> 00:02:43.335
that would benefit him or goodness that will reach him.

00:02:45.155 --> 00:02:48.315
Then, there is the Sunnah of the Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him)

00:02:48.315 --> 00:02:49.315
is the second revelation

00:02:49.455 --> 00:02:51.655
and the second foundation, whoever denies/rejects it disbelieves

00:02:51.985 --> 00:02:54.165
Whoever denies/rejects it and says there is no need for me in it

00:02:54.495 --> 00:02:56.925
he is a misguided disbeliever, according to the consensus of the Muslims.

00:02:57.895 --> 00:02:59.145
It's the second foundation

00:03:00.155 --> 00:03:01.765
Allah revealed it to his prophet (peace and  blessings be upon him)

00:03:02.395 --> 00:03:03.895
to explain the book of Allah

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.080
and guide to what's in it

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.300
and to explain it's rulings by following the Sunnah.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.480
Exalted is He, said, And We revealed to you the message

00:03:13.825 --> 00:03:15.565
that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them (16:44)

00:03:16.185 --> 00:03:18.765
Allah made His prophet (peace and blessings be upon him)  to explain to the people

00:03:19.355 --> 00:03:22.355
and to clarify what hasn't been made clear to them from the book of Allah.

00:03:23.775 --> 00:03:25.475
For the Sunnah clarifies the Qur'an,

00:03:25.995 --> 00:03:28.135
to use as an evidence and to explain it.

00:03:28.465 --> 00:03:29.885
And I advice my brothers

00:03:30.465 --> 00:03:33.135
the people and students of  knowledge, to take care of the Sunnah

00:03:34.055 --> 00:03:35.105
and to be diligent in it

00:03:35.835 --> 00:03:38.095
and to go over its texts and chain of narrations

00:03:38.545 --> 00:03:40.825
and to be diligent in memorizing what you are able to.

00:03:41.875 --> 00:03:43.275
And I also advice,

00:03:43.625 --> 00:03:44.885
Umdat Ul Hadith,

00:03:45.365 --> 00:03:46.505
and Buloogh Al Maraam

00:03:47.075 --> 00:03:48.595
that you memorize these two books

00:03:49.175 --> 00:03:51.215
for they are quite beneficial,

00:03:53.035 --> 00:03:55.335
especially for the student of knowledge.

00:03:55.865 --> 00:03:57.655
These two books have great value.

00:03:57.965 --> 00:04:01.025
And if he is able to memorize Muntaqa Al Akhbar,

00:04:01.025 --> 00:04:04.045
then that will be goodness upon goodness and light upon light.

00:04:04.275 --> 00:04:05.625
However, at least,

00:04:06.065 --> 00:04:09.045
Umdat Ul Hadith by Sheikh AbdulGhani

00:04:09.045 --> 00:04:11.985
and Buloogh Al Maraam by Ibn Hajar, these two books

00:04:12.445 --> 00:04:14.855
are from the best and most beneficial books.

00:04:15.335 --> 00:04:18.335
I advice my brothers to memorize them

00:04:18.335 --> 00:04:21.735
and to take great care of them for they help

00:04:22.235 --> 00:04:24.995
understanding the Book according to what came in the Sunnah.

00:04:26.695 --> 00:04:27.695
Then,

00:04:28.285 --> 00:04:29.285
I also advice

00:04:29.555 --> 00:04:31.155
all my brothers,

00:04:31.515 --> 00:04:32.875
among men and women,

00:04:34.295 --> 00:04:37.195
from what was mentioned previously by giving great concern to the Book and the Sunnah.

00:04:37.455 --> 00:04:38.685
I also advice,

00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:41.445
to listen to the Qur'an radio station,

00:04:42.055 --> 00:04:43.055
for

00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:46.405
some people might not be able to read the Qu'ran

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.200
or maybe his recitation is not proper,

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.860
so he should listen

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:53.925
to the recitation of the Qur'an from the radio station for there's a lot of goodness

00:04:53.925 --> 00:04:56.765
and benefit and religious talks

00:04:57.215 --> 00:04:58.955
the student of knowledge would benefit from

00:04:59.315 --> 00:05:02.235
as well as the Muslims in general from men and women.

00:05:02.825 --> 00:05:04.805
So I would advice with the Qur'an radio station

00:05:05.175 --> 00:05:06.815
and to busy oneself to listening to it

00:05:07.145 --> 00:05:08.445
and to benefit from it

00:05:08.815 --> 00:05:10.375
I advice as well,

00:05:10.855 --> 00:05:12.525
with the radio program Nur Ala Darb.

00:05:13.145 --> 00:05:14.725
The program Nur Ala Darb,

00:05:15.035 --> 00:05:17.085
has a group of people of knowledge,

00:05:18.445 --> 00:05:21.505
who are asked and they answer them. So I advice

00:05:21.505 --> 00:05:24.775
to listen to this program and to benefit from it

00:05:25.175 --> 00:05:26.225
and especially

00:05:26.635 --> 00:05:28.075
the general Muslims

00:05:28.555 --> 00:05:30.845
because the benefit from it is tremendous.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.740
Verily, the believers

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.740
benefit from this program while they are

00:05:37.135 --> 00:05:40.045
in their beds, or their gatherings,

00:05:40.045 --> 00:05:42.020
or in their cars.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.300
and this is from the blessings of Allah

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.800
and a bounty from Allah.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.060
So it is upon them to busy themselves and take advantage of this.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.380
And this is what I have to say. I don't want to make this longer.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.740
I ask Allah to grant us success with beneficial knowledge and righteous actions.
