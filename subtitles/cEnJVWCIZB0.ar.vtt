00:00:00.435 --> 00:00:01.435
 

00:00:01.435 --> 00:00:03.905
 

00:00:04.175 --> 00:00:05.175
 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.120
 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.740
The language spoken by God Almighty on the Day of Resurrection

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.600
 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.460
We conclude this meeting with this question

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.700
The questioner says: What language does God speak?

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.700
On the Day of Resurrection to his servants, they explained to us that they were hired?

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.680
The texts appear to be Arabic

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.760
The apparent text of the Prophet ﷺ that he speaks people in Arabic,

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.920
God Almighty knows the most, the apparent texts contained in his speech in Arabic

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.420
I do not know that he is speaking to others,

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.680
He is omnipotent , knows everything, knows all languages,

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.400
It is not hidden from it, but it is clear that the text is that it addresses people on the Day of Resurrection in Arabic

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.180
And that the language of the people of Paradise is Arabic,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.800
They speak this language known to the people of Paradise, and God addresses them as it is apparent texts

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.000
He Almighty knows everything and is appreciated for everything,

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:22.780
And on all languages , and know the conditions of its people, and reward them for their actions as they deserve. Yeah

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.735
 

00:01:25.735 --> 00:01:28.035
