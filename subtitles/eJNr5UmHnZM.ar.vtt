00:00:26.103 --> 00:00:28.016
Allah created the heavens and earth

00:00:28.016 --> 00:00:30.276
and determined therein its [creatures'] sustenance

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:31.719
He created in the heavens and earth

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:33.846
everything we need to live in peace

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:37.180
until Allah inherits the earth and whoever is on it.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.612
Earth's lungs are its forests,

00:00:39.812 --> 00:00:40.747
its oceans,

00:00:40.747 --> 00:00:41.842
and its rivers.

00:00:42.013 --> 00:00:43.235
A balance

00:00:43.235 --> 00:00:45.641
that earth's been built upon for billions of years

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:47.141
Then man came.

00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:48.135
Then

00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:49.566
man came.

00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:56.483
We destroyed crops and animals.

00:00:56.975 --> 00:00:58.156
We lit the flames of war,

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:59.241
destroyed

00:00:59.443 --> 00:01:00.034
displaced.

00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:01.430
We oppressed one another.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.241
We spared nothing,

00:01:04.491 --> 00:01:07.117
no human and no animal.

00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:08.934
We spread corruption on earth

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.768
until it complained to its Creator.

00:01:12.688 --> 00:01:13.942
Some people die of hunger,

00:01:14.104 --> 00:01:15.356
and others of eating too much.

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:16.687
Many are forced to flee

00:01:16.687 --> 00:01:18.079
so a handful can live in luxury.

00:01:18.285 --> 00:01:19.134
Destruction

00:01:19.134 --> 00:01:19.969
Collapse

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:21.356
Corruption and injustice

00:01:22.108 --> 00:01:22.775
But

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:25.245
do not despair of Allah's spirit.

00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:26.627
Man

00:01:27.142 --> 00:01:27.835
has a choice.

00:01:28.163 --> 00:01:29.417
Just as there is bad,

00:01:29.551 --> 00:01:30.836
there is good.

00:01:31.076 --> 00:01:32.315
In the face of corruption

00:01:32.493 --> 00:01:33.873
stands benevolence.

00:01:33.943 --> 00:01:35.746
With hardship must

00:01:35.746 --> 00:01:37.506
come ease.

00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:39.667
We sent people to the moon,

00:01:39.828 --> 00:01:41.682
and defeated deadly diseases.

00:01:41.805 --> 00:01:43.836
We built skyscrapers,

00:01:43.963 --> 00:01:46.157
We've soared between earth and sky.

00:01:46.335 --> 00:01:47.784
We erased illiteracy

00:01:47.937 --> 00:01:49.353
in many parts of the world.

00:01:49.744 --> 00:01:50.394
We've invented,

00:01:50.394 --> 00:01:50.928
risen,

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.047
and built.

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:54.872
And this is just the beginning of the journey,

00:01:55.044 --> 00:01:57.376
for the journey to excellence is long.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.200
We'll stumble,

00:01:58.661 --> 00:01:59.830
only to stand back up.

00:01:59.877 --> 00:02:01.693
We can overcome

00:02:01.924 --> 00:02:03.311
a mountain of difficulties.

00:02:03.443 --> 00:02:05.561
We must populate and develop the earth.

00:02:05.702 --> 00:02:08.916
Is the reward for good [anything] but good?

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.329
"Khawater 11"

00:02:21.956 --> 00:02:24.507
"Everyone Was Created For Something"

00:02:25.361 --> 00:02:26.554
Every one has a talent.

00:02:26.731 --> 00:02:31.185
Allah gave all humans a talent or more,

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.453
but they differ.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.714
The secret is to know your talent

00:02:34.714 --> 00:02:36.455
and build on it.

00:02:36.455 --> 00:02:38.470
In this episode, we collaborated with

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.989
the creative Mr. Ahmad Al-Assad,

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.898
a man who dedicates his life

00:02:41.898 --> 00:02:44.519
to promoting the idea of talents

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.235
and discovering youth's talents.

00:02:46.235 --> 00:02:48.110
Summarize the definition of a talent.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.870
Very briefly?

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.289
Yes

00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:52.753
Anything...

00:02:52.753 --> 00:02:53.178
No, briefly!

00:02:53.178 --> 00:02:54.273
I just started.

00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:57.498
I want it summarized in one letter.

00:02:57.705 --> 00:03:01.033
A talent is simply a natural behavior

00:03:01.033 --> 00:03:04.435
I enjoy and I excel at it compared to others.

00:03:05.607 --> 00:03:09.225
We're going to do some hidden camera scenes

00:03:09.424 --> 00:03:13.503
to find out people's talents,

00:03:13.692 --> 00:03:14.953
some of the talents.

00:03:14.953 --> 00:03:16.091
The principled person.

00:03:16.465 --> 00:03:17.519
I don't know if we'll find them

00:03:18.402 --> 00:03:19.702
Why the pessimism?

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:20.429
I don't know

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:21.228
Is it hard?

00:03:21.228 --> 00:03:22.310
It's hard

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.304
because people may be principled

00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:26.546
but they don't want to spread them

00:03:26.546 --> 00:03:27.287
and think, "What do I have to do with it?"

00:03:27.287 --> 00:03:28.899
Basically it's someone who doesn't stay silent

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:29.675
if they see something wrong.

00:03:29.675 --> 00:03:30.062
Exactly

00:03:30.062 --> 00:03:30.891
What are we going to do?

00:03:30.891 --> 00:03:32.319
We'll do the following:

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.177
We're going to enter a supermarket

00:03:34.177 --> 00:03:36.116
and I'll pretend like I'm on the phone

00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:37.230
and while I'm on the phone,

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.008
when someone passes by me,

00:03:38.008 --> 00:03:41.833
I'll open a juice bottle and drink from it

00:03:41.833 --> 00:03:43.509
and say, "No one cares,

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:44.829
even if someone sees me, they won't say anything."

00:03:45.487 --> 00:03:48.740
"Even if I open half the juice bottles no one cares.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.136
No one cares in the country right now,

00:03:51.136 --> 00:03:52.909
even if I drink all the juice,

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:54.872
no one will say anything.

00:03:59.565 --> 00:04:00.695
Most people ignored,

00:04:00.695 --> 00:04:01.537
a lot of people ignored.

00:04:01.537 --> 00:04:02.607
They saw and walked on.

00:04:02.607 --> 00:04:05.692
Yes, and some people looked

00:04:05.692 --> 00:04:10.995
but thought, "what do I have to do with this?"

00:04:10.995 --> 00:04:13.174
If I drink all the juice here, no one will say anything.

00:04:13.174 --> 00:04:14.869
Trust me, no one cares.

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:16.973
No one can see me, I'll drink what I want,

00:04:18.781 --> 00:04:23.070
and put it back and it's like nothing happened.

00:04:23.784 --> 00:04:24.795
Okay, bye.

00:04:26.707 --> 00:04:27.315
What?

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:29.435
Are you not going to pay for these things?

00:04:29.633 --> 00:04:31.801
Uh...Yeah what's the problem?

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.519
Anything bad you do will only hurt you,

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:37.651
I'm serious.

00:04:37.769 --> 00:04:40.036
Honestly, it only costs 5 pounds, or ten.

00:04:40.036 --> 00:04:41.960
Which the workers will have to pay.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:42.827
No, the company will.

00:04:42.827 --> 00:04:45.814
This supermarket makes millions

00:04:45.865 --> 00:04:48.795
so it doesn't matter if I drink something.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.270
They're unjust anyways,

00:04:50.334 --> 00:04:52.113
their prices are so high.

00:04:52.113 --> 00:04:55.323
Everyone's responsible for what they do

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.416
and will be held accountable.

00:04:57.754 --> 00:04:59.388
Why do others matter to you?

00:04:59.388 --> 00:05:00.726
What do you mean?

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.619
Why do you care about companies?

00:05:02.696 --> 00:05:04.035
What goes around comes around.

00:05:04.593 --> 00:05:05.014
Sorry?

00:05:05.242 --> 00:05:06.034
What goes around comes around,

00:05:06.203 --> 00:05:07.219
so what you do to others

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:08.370
will be done to you.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.915
You're right.

00:05:08.915 --> 00:05:09.879
Why did you teach him a lesson

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:10.782
instead of ignoring?

00:05:10.782 --> 00:05:13.711
You can't ignore it every time you something wrong.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.721
Were you always like this?

00:05:16.271 --> 00:05:16.912
I'm a teacher.

00:05:17.212 --> 00:05:18.204
A teacher

00:05:18.415 --> 00:05:22.917
I'm used to making people pay attention to what they do,

00:05:22.917 --> 00:05:23.572
not just the students,

00:05:23.572 --> 00:05:24.936
so maybe the career...

00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:27.829
The principled person talent,

00:05:27.829 --> 00:05:28.814
where do they fit?

00:05:28.814 --> 00:05:29.689
In judicial positions,

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:31.526
police,

00:05:31.526 --> 00:05:33.016
law,

00:05:33.167 --> 00:05:34.757
all the fundamental fields,

00:05:34.825 --> 00:05:37.028
as teachers.

00:05:37.205 --> 00:05:42.369
Basically a principled person should be in jobs

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:44.951
where it's difficult to monitor them all the time.

00:05:44.951 --> 00:05:46.795
This is fundamental to the rise of the Arab

00:05:46.795 --> 00:05:47.853
and Islamic world today.

00:05:47.853 --> 00:05:48.721
We call upon schools

00:05:48.721 --> 00:05:50.059
to start spreading the idea of

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:54.347
talent tests from middle school.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.076
We shouldn't wait until youth graduate from

00:05:56.076 --> 00:05:58.392
university and then tell them what their talent is.

00:05:58.392 --> 00:06:00.032
There are 34 different talents that one can have.

00:06:00.032 --> 00:06:01.139
34 talents

00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:02.587
Exactly, and each person has

00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:04.443
at least one or more talents.

00:06:04.518 --> 00:06:07.186
So a personality test is necessary.

00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:09.173
If it isn't offered in schools,

00:06:09.322 --> 00:06:10.453
you can find it on the Internet.

00:06:10.571 --> 00:06:13.151
Anyone can go online and do the test.

00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:17.480
It'll show your top five talents

00:06:17.672 --> 00:06:20.585
and the careers that match these talents.

00:06:20.662 --> 00:06:22.749
If your talent is communication

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:23.972
and interacting with people

00:06:23.972 --> 00:06:25.530
and you enjoy talking to people

00:06:25.671 --> 00:06:26.489
you shouldn't work as an accountant.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.142
Just you and the computer screen,

00:06:29.142 --> 00:06:30.472
sitting in an office with numbers.

00:06:30.814 --> 00:06:31.918
And the opposite is also true.

00:06:31.918 --> 00:06:33.340
If you're good with numbers

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.536
and you enjoy systematic work

00:06:35.536 --> 00:06:39.588
and math and you have an engineering mind,

00:06:39.588 --> 00:06:41.533
you shouldn't work as a sales person.

00:06:41.666 --> 00:06:42.465
And so on.

00:06:42.465 --> 00:06:44.608
Each talent has matching jobs.

00:06:44.824 --> 00:06:46.747
People always say they want to reach innovation.

00:06:46.897 --> 00:06:51.436
The fastest and best way to reach innovation,

00:06:51.436 --> 00:06:53.083
which is extraordinary productivity,

00:06:53.254 --> 00:06:54.476
is by taking advantage of my talent

00:06:54.476 --> 00:06:56.113
and building on it with knowledge

00:06:56.113 --> 00:06:57.190
and skill and this is how I reach innovation.

00:06:57.371 --> 00:06:58.577
Give us a new talent.

00:06:58.713 --> 00:07:00.447
This next talent is one of the best talents ever,

00:07:00.588 --> 00:07:02.788
a talent I consider that of prophets.

00:07:02.788 --> 00:07:05.923
It can be a virtue or a vice.

00:07:05.923 --> 00:07:09.197
The ability to persuade people.

00:07:09.315 --> 00:07:10.690
Communication

00:07:11.347 --> 00:07:11.986
and eloquence

00:07:12.212 --> 00:07:13.256
Okay

00:07:13.398 --> 00:07:14.789
How will we embody this?

00:07:14.988 --> 00:07:19.566
By getting a strange and abstract painting

00:07:19.714 --> 00:07:20.991
and we'll bring four judges

00:07:21.151 --> 00:07:22.868
and contestants,

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:25.740
who will have 90 seconds to convince you

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.508
that this is most beautiful painting in the world.

00:07:28.988 --> 00:07:30.330
And you will evaluate them, form a score of ten.

00:07:30.513 --> 00:07:31.080
Okay

00:07:31.323 --> 00:07:33.533
The painting is unique

00:07:33.533 --> 00:07:35.639
and different than any other painting you've seen.

00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:39.147
It's colors are bright and pleasant.

00:07:39.147 --> 00:07:41.589
It attracts you eye to every color.

00:07:41.677 --> 00:07:47.057
The spilling paint mixes all the colors

00:07:47.057 --> 00:07:49.411
so the yellow, green and blue

00:07:49.411 --> 00:07:51.154
gives you a new kind of painting

00:07:51.391 --> 00:07:54.148
instead of a boring painting.

00:07:54.148 --> 00:07:56.228
Some people were comfortable speaking

00:07:56.228 --> 00:07:58.371
and others started making stuff up.

00:07:58.371 --> 00:08:02.067
As listeners, we know who is or isn't persuasive.

00:08:02.168 --> 00:08:04.016
Even if they try to imitate others.

00:08:04.177 --> 00:08:05.485
What's great about this talent is that

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:06.515
you can't really imitate others.

00:08:06.515 --> 00:08:11.289
You can't imitate other's emotions.

00:08:11.436 --> 00:08:18.323
Statistically, 13% are talented in communication.

00:08:18.736 --> 00:08:19.665
In front of people?

00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:20.125
Yes

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:21.001
You're one in ten.

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:23.351
So a small percentage.

00:08:23.351 --> 00:08:24.117
Very small.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.171
It's not the prettiest painting in the world

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:30.141
but the idea us that it shows...

00:08:33.873 --> 00:08:34.477
a specific idea

00:08:35.571 --> 00:08:36.209
in this painting.

00:08:36.651 --> 00:08:37.800
What's the idea?

00:08:37.952 --> 00:08:38.519
The idea

00:08:42.913 --> 00:08:46.434
You'll get there.

00:08:46.434 --> 00:08:49.315
Every one looks at their own lives through

00:08:49.315 --> 00:08:50.039
their own perspective.

00:08:50.316 --> 00:08:51.461
Before you buy a painting,

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.365
you'll think of it with your heart.

00:08:53.546 --> 00:08:54.583
When you look at a painting,

00:08:54.747 --> 00:08:56.447
look at it with your emotions.

00:08:56.447 --> 00:08:58.508
The colors give tranquility.

00:08:58.508 --> 00:09:01.103
Every one has a color that represents them.

00:09:01.103 --> 00:09:04.620
Why not picture the person you love in this painting,

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.355
and they're crying inside?

00:09:06.407 --> 00:09:09.401
They can work as lawyers,

00:09:09.483 --> 00:09:12.779
at radio stations, teachers, coaches,

00:09:12.779 --> 00:09:15.641
several fields, but when you look at a lawyer,

00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:17.107
show host, or actor

00:09:17.245 --> 00:09:18.385
you can tell whether they're good or not.

00:09:18.422 --> 00:09:20.144
If they're good, then they likely have this talent.

00:09:20.359 --> 00:09:22.068
Parents, fathers and mothers,

00:09:22.212 --> 00:09:24.728
please, please, there's no reason to force

00:09:24.842 --> 00:09:27.202
our children to go into fields they don't want,

00:09:27.386 --> 00:09:31.682
fields they're not talented at.

00:09:31.852 --> 00:09:34.956
It's very important for parents to support

00:09:34.956 --> 00:09:38.977
their children in choosing fields that suit them,

00:09:38.977 --> 00:09:40.909
not us, parents.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:43.952
One of the secrets behid the success of the society

00:09:43.952 --> 00:09:47.191
in Medina, at the time of the prophet (PBUH)

00:09:47.361 --> 00:09:51.916
is that he put every person in the right place

00:09:52.067 --> 00:09:53.754
based on their talent.

00:09:53.785 --> 00:09:54.609
This is clear

00:09:54.771 --> 00:09:55.953
in the way he dealt with people.

00:09:56.187 --> 00:09:58.812
He didn't force someone who isn't talented

00:09:58.812 --> 00:10:00.716
at something to do it.

00:10:00.716 --> 00:10:02.177
For example,

00:10:02.177 --> 00:10:03.872
Khalid ibn al-Walid

00:10:05.606 --> 00:10:06.798
is known for what?

00:10:06.798 --> 00:10:09.799
He was a genius at war and planning for war

00:10:09.799 --> 00:10:11.040
and leading armies.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.343
When he became a Muslim and went to

00:10:13.343 --> 00:10:15.786
the Prophet (PBUH), did he tell him

00:10:15.786 --> 00:10:18.288
to sit for two years and memorize the Qur'an

00:10:18.288 --> 00:10:21.423
and learn jurisprudence?

00:10:21.423 --> 00:10:23.188
No, this isn't his field.

00:10:23.188 --> 00:10:26.030
Immediately after Khalid ibn al-Walid became Muslim

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.029
where did the Prophet (PBUH) put him?

00:10:28.398 --> 00:10:29.509
In the army.

00:10:29.803 --> 00:10:33.574
And he lead companions who converted to Islam before him.

00:10:33.574 --> 00:10:36.820
This is why we don't hear hadiths narrated

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:38.665
by Khalid ibn al-Walid.

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:41.456
How many hadiths did you hear narrated by him?

00:10:42.296 --> 00:10:43.643
There almost aren't any.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.433
Why?

00:10:44.433 --> 00:10:45.599
Because this is his focus.

00:10:45.599 --> 00:10:47.269
His talent is leading armies

00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:49.796
and because his talent was invested,

00:10:49.796 --> 00:10:52.176
he played a major role in conquests

00:10:52.176 --> 00:10:55.155
in the Levant and Iraq and other places.

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:57.509
Today, we're searching for a very important talent.

00:10:57.737 --> 00:11:00.069
A talent that gives hope,

00:11:00.369 --> 00:11:02.596
The talent of positivity.

00:11:02.916 --> 00:11:05.147
They have an ability to look at something negative

00:11:05.147 --> 00:11:06.098
and turn it into something positive.

00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:07.671
What's the first word that comes to mind when

00:11:07.671 --> 00:11:08.481
you look at this photo?

00:11:10.775 --> 00:11:12.001
Simplicity of life

00:11:12.157 --> 00:11:12.643
Palestine

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:13.477
Palestine

00:11:13.641 --> 00:11:16.745
They look happy even if they don't have much.

00:11:16.854 --> 00:11:17.243
Strange

00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:17.553
I don't know

00:11:17.553 --> 00:11:19.857
There's poverty and depression.

00:11:20.315 --> 00:11:21.272
I don't see that.

00:11:21.272 --> 00:11:21.939
Poor people

00:11:21.939 --> 00:11:22.457
Homeless people

00:11:22.819 --> 00:11:23.357
Poverty

00:11:23.357 --> 00:11:24.205
Miserable people

00:11:24.205 --> 00:11:24.896
Miserable people

00:11:24.896 --> 00:11:26.943
Poverty, marginalization

00:11:27.676 --> 00:11:28.559
May Allah help them

00:11:29.882 --> 00:11:30.599
Poverty

00:11:30.745 --> 00:11:31.795
Poverty, why?

00:11:31.882 --> 00:11:36.433
Because they don't look clean and their clothing.

00:11:36.433 --> 00:11:38.771
Simplicity, maybe.

00:11:39.194 --> 00:11:39.889
Why?

00:11:39.889 --> 00:11:43.557
Maybe because they're dressed simply

00:11:43.557 --> 00:11:45.361
and they're smiling.

00:11:45.558 --> 00:11:49.332
Why didn't you see poverty and misery?

00:11:49.551 --> 00:11:52.011
Maybe it depends on your approach to life.

00:11:52.407 --> 00:11:55.073
If you're positive and always look at

00:11:55.073 --> 00:11:56.695
the full half of the cup.

00:11:57.092 --> 00:12:02.735
Did you ever hear of Hassan ibn Thabet in battle?

00:12:02.942 --> 00:12:03.516
No.

00:12:03.782 --> 00:12:06.252
Hassan Ibn Thabet's power is poetry.

00:12:06.411 --> 00:12:07.346
Poetry!

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:11.620
So the Prophet (PBUH) didn't put him in jihad

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.224
or asked him to lead armies.

00:12:13.519 --> 00:12:16.358
He was in charge of speaking.

00:12:17.328 --> 00:12:22.204
He was spokesperson of Medina, Islam and Muslims.

00:12:22.204 --> 00:12:24.900
His talent in poetry was invested.

00:12:26.109 --> 00:12:27.472
You'll find that the Prophet (PBUH)

00:12:27.472 --> 00:12:28.799
invested each companion,

00:12:28.799 --> 00:12:32.404
which is why one man of them

00:12:32.404 --> 00:12:33.796
was worth a thousand men.

00:12:33.996 --> 00:12:36.134
How?

00:12:36.288 --> 00:12:38.844
By being placed in a field they are talented at.

00:12:38.986 --> 00:12:40.080
This is one of the basics.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.116
It's impossible for one man to be with a thousand

00:12:42.116 --> 00:12:44.731
if they were put in a field that doesn't match

00:12:44.731 --> 00:12:47.659
their nature, talent, and abilities.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.094
This is a secret to how Medina,

00:12:50.094 --> 00:12:52.798
a community of a few thousands,

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:56.258
reached Andalusia and China

00:12:56.258 --> 00:12:59.626
and excelled in science, economics,

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.421
jurisprudence, war

00:13:02.421 --> 00:13:06.356
and excelled in all areas of life

00:13:06.356 --> 00:13:08.929
during h=the height of Islamic civilization.

00:13:09.121 --> 00:13:11.889
Each individual was in the field they excel at.

00:13:12.845 --> 00:13:13.434
Tahrir Square

00:13:15.933 --> 00:13:18.008
I'm in a hurry, can I get in?

00:13:18.468 --> 00:13:19.798
He stopped me first.

00:13:19.798 --> 00:13:20.077
Can I take it?

00:13:20.077 --> 00:13:20.880
Yes

00:13:21.595 --> 00:13:22.140
Are you sure?

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:22.678
Yes

00:13:22.678 --> 00:13:23.791
If you want it, it's okay.

00:13:23.791 --> 00:13:24.655
Get in.

00:13:24.655 --> 00:13:25.197
Sure?

00:13:25.197 --> 00:13:26.404
Yeah, go ahead.

00:13:27.911 --> 00:13:29.070
The guy came first.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:30.873
Listen, if you want to get in

00:13:30.873 --> 00:13:31.676
we can go together.

00:13:31.676 --> 00:13:32.076
It's okay.

00:13:32.076 --> 00:13:32.640
Sure?

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:33.397
Thank you

00:13:35.557 --> 00:13:36.537
Why did you do that?

00:13:36.537 --> 00:13:38.329
He was in a hurry and might have

00:13:38.329 --> 00:13:40.104
had an emergency, he has to take it first.

00:13:40.275 --> 00:13:42.228
So you thought he could need it more.

00:13:42.228 --> 00:13:44.233
Yeah, I'm serious.

00:13:44.492 --> 00:13:46.614
So you were flexible and not bothered?

00:13:46.614 --> 00:13:47.794
Yeah, why would I be bothered?

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:49.676
He wasn't forced to.

00:13:49.676 --> 00:13:50.427
No, not at all.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.005
Egypt is full of taxis and you were in a hurry.

00:13:54.216 --> 00:13:56.673
Others might get angry.

00:13:56.673 --> 00:13:58.232
Yeah, not everyone's like this.

00:13:58.232 --> 00:13:59.520
This is the flexibility talent.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.195
Thank you

00:14:00.195 --> 00:14:01.139
Flexible Mahmoud

00:14:01.139 --> 00:14:03.073
Flexible Mr. Mahmoud

00:14:06.149 --> 00:14:07.060
Where are you headed?

00:14:07.228 --> 00:14:08.449
By the police station

00:14:08.597 --> 00:14:09.722
The one in Giza?

00:14:09.722 --> 00:14:12.530
I'm in a hurry, can I get to Masr El-Gedida?

00:14:12.672 --> 00:14:14.154
Can you drop me and then him?

00:14:14.967 --> 00:14:16.304
I'm in a hurry, can I go?

00:14:16.304 --> 00:14:16.862
What do you think?

00:14:16.862 --> 00:14:17.255
Go ahead

00:14:17.255 --> 00:14:17.607
Are you sure?

00:14:17.607 --> 00:14:18.916
Go ahead

00:14:18.916 --> 00:14:20.134
No, it's okay.

00:14:20.134 --> 00:14:21.342
I don't want to bother you.

00:14:21.342 --> 00:14:21.886
Don't worry about it.

00:14:21.886 --> 00:14:22.260
Sure?

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.025
Go ahead

00:14:23.025 --> 00:14:24.664
How come you're so nice?

00:14:24.664 --> 00:14:27.290
I'm sorry

00:14:29.904 --> 00:14:30.587
You're very flexible.

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:31.725
Thank you

00:14:35.081 --> 00:14:35.810
Can I get in?

00:14:36.516 --> 00:14:37.509
She stopped me first.

00:14:37.741 --> 00:14:38.688
Where are you going?

00:14:38.893 --> 00:14:39.409
What?

00:14:39.557 --> 00:14:40.280
Where are you going?

00:14:40.438 --> 00:14:41.529
I need to go to Gold Island.

00:14:41.588 --> 00:14:43.573
No, it's not on the way

00:14:43.573 --> 00:14:44.644
and she stopped me.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.206
Can I get in?

00:14:49.173 --> 00:14:51.234
He'll drop me first and then you

00:14:51.443 --> 00:14:51.852
Sorry?

00:14:51.852 --> 00:14:54.160
He'll drop me first and you can come later.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.914
I'm in a hurry and need to take a taxi now.

00:14:56.914 --> 00:14:59.022
You can take another taxi.

00:14:59.022 --> 00:14:59.773
I know but I'm in a rush.

00:14:59.773 --> 00:15:01.344
I'm invited for breakfast with my friends.

00:15:01.344 --> 00:15:04.594
You'll find another taxi.

00:15:04.594 --> 00:15:06.155
You could do that too.

00:15:06.155 --> 00:15:08.676
But I'm comfortable with him.

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:10.217
Wow!

00:15:10.575 --> 00:15:11.008
Can I?

00:15:11.008 --> 00:15:11.572
No

00:15:11.572 --> 00:15:13.679
There are so many taxis, please.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:15.963
No one has all the talents.

00:15:15.963 --> 00:15:18.701
It's not bad if you don't have all the talents

00:15:18.701 --> 00:15:20.074
we covered in the episode.

00:15:20.074 --> 00:15:22.346
Every human was created for something.

00:15:22.575 --> 00:15:25.540
If a person has one talent, they won't have another.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.206
For example, the flexibility talent,

00:15:27.206 --> 00:15:28.749
I don't have it at all.

00:15:29.014 --> 00:15:31.776
If I were put in the taxi situation,

00:15:31.776 --> 00:15:33.682
there's no way I would anyone take it.

00:15:34.586 --> 00:15:36.560
I look at it as my right.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.232
I came first, there's a system.

00:15:38.463 --> 00:15:42.327
Some people might say this isn't flexibility

00:15:42.417 --> 00:15:47.033
it's weakness and giving up your right,

00:15:47.369 --> 00:15:48.192
but no, not necessarily.

00:15:48.636 --> 00:15:52.444
Subhanallah, every talent plays a role.

00:15:52.743 --> 00:15:55.425
What's the difference between flexibility

00:15:55.425 --> 00:15:57.832
and insisting on what's yours?

00:15:57.832 --> 00:15:59.394
Because in the end it's her right to get in

00:15:59.394 --> 00:16:00.927
because she came first.

00:16:01.162 --> 00:16:03.595
Subhnallah, everyone was created for something.

00:16:03.856 --> 00:16:06.679
A flexible person doesn't look at the situation

00:16:06.679 --> 00:16:09.990
through right and wrong but empathizes with others.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.091
If you need something, I can feel with you,

00:16:13.138 --> 00:16:14.400
I'm flexible and don't get upset.

00:16:14.555 --> 00:16:16.314
The flexibility talent is basically

00:16:16.511 --> 00:16:18.443
that the person isn't upset about their plans changing.

00:16:18.762 --> 00:16:21.954
Flexibility requires giving up your right.

00:16:22.215 --> 00:16:23.551
They don't consider it giving up.

00:16:23.551 --> 00:16:24.841
They see it as helping.

00:16:24.841 --> 00:16:27.761
The person with this talent doesn't feel like

00:16:27.761 --> 00:16:29.343
they're giving up something, but that they're helping.

00:16:29.343 --> 00:16:32.048
So, we can't say that others who demanded

00:16:32.048 --> 00:16:33.109
their rights are necessarily wrong

00:16:33.109 --> 00:16:34.278
because in the end it's their right.

00:16:34.278 --> 00:16:34.975
They have another talent.

00:16:34.975 --> 00:16:36.841
They might be strict.

00:16:36.841 --> 00:16:40.707
Yes there's a talent called the commander.

00:16:40.707 --> 00:16:44.524
The commander insists on their opinion or belief.

00:16:44.524 --> 00:16:45.461
This is also beneficial at times.

00:16:45.543 --> 00:16:46.400
Exactly

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.270
How will we discover the talent of Mr. Ideas?

00:16:48.348 --> 00:16:49.641
We'll ask a simple question:

00:16:49.641 --> 00:16:52.074
Give us the largest number of products

00:16:52.074 --> 00:16:55.912
that can be made using wood chips.

00:16:56.155 --> 00:16:59.288
There are no conditions,

00:16:59.484 --> 00:17:00.868
just give us ideas.

00:17:01.096 --> 00:17:04.115
Some people might only get one or two ideas.

00:17:04.115 --> 00:17:05.116
They'll stop.

00:17:05.146 --> 00:17:06.271
It can be used in weddings.

00:17:06.271 --> 00:17:07.752
Good, that's one.

00:17:08.147 --> 00:17:09.271
You have one minute,

00:17:09.271 --> 00:17:10.328
give me the biggest number of products,

00:17:10.328 --> 00:17:11.327
get creative.

00:17:11.327 --> 00:17:12.245
Weddings...

00:17:12.245 --> 00:17:13.166
Anything

00:17:13.166 --> 00:17:14.650
That's the only think I know.

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:15.454
What else?

00:17:15.454 --> 00:17:16.181
That's it.

00:17:17.922 --> 00:17:18.674
Wood chips...

00:17:22.594 --> 00:17:23.390
I don't know.

00:17:23.704 --> 00:17:25.678
You can light it and make a fire.

00:17:25.895 --> 00:17:26.404
Give me 20.

00:17:26.404 --> 00:17:27.438
Give you 20?

00:17:27.438 --> 00:17:28.251
20 ideas

00:17:28.251 --> 00:17:30.786
20 ideas...

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:35.280
That's it

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:35.919
That's it?

00:17:36.206 --> 00:17:38.063
Other people said twp or three

00:17:38.063 --> 00:17:38.678
and the highest was eight.

00:17:38.678 --> 00:17:39.627
Eight ideas!

00:17:39.627 --> 00:17:40.675
Eight ideas and they were good.

00:17:40.675 --> 00:17:41.758
If someone cleans the sidewalk and

00:17:41.758 --> 00:17:42.837
throws it on it.

00:17:42.837 --> 00:17:44.380
One, what else.

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.559
You can paint it yellow, green and red

00:17:46.559 --> 00:17:47.676
and other colors

00:17:47.676 --> 00:17:49.626
and use it in weddings.

00:17:49.626 --> 00:17:50.928
Nice! Two

00:17:50.928 --> 00:17:54.281
You can make art pieces of a bride and groom.

00:17:54.521 --> 00:17:55.337
Three.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:56.991
Three, what else?

00:17:57.045 --> 00:17:59.631
When we want to sacrifice, we can throw it on the blood.

00:17:59.631 --> 00:18:00.195
Why?

00:18:01.222 --> 00:18:02.154
To cover the blood.

00:18:02.154 --> 00:18:03.280
Nice, four

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:07.420
It can be stuffed in wood.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.280
Excellent! More, that's five.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:12.312
You're starting to get creative.

00:18:12.312 --> 00:18:13.886
Give me more than five.

00:18:13.886 --> 00:18:15.959
We can make an Egyptian flag

00:18:16.651 --> 00:18:17.222
Six

00:18:17.866 --> 00:18:18.490
Seven

00:18:18.557 --> 00:18:21.951
And a sign like this with a picture of a flag or something

00:18:22.083 --> 00:18:22.855
Eight

00:18:22.855 --> 00:18:25.197
This is where Mr. Ahmad Al-Assad's specialty

00:18:25.197 --> 00:18:26.652
comes in.

00:18:26.891 --> 00:18:30.584
Whoever wants to benefit from Mr. Ahmad

00:18:30.584 --> 00:18:32.089
and his experience and expertise,

00:18:34.074 --> 00:18:34.631
give me.

00:18:34.703 --> 00:18:35.962
The website is

00:18:39.431 --> 00:18:40.109
All that?

00:18:41.166 --> 00:18:44.108
and for those who want to try a free personality test

00:18:44.108 --> 00:18:45.826
can add "/test"

00:18:47.129 --> 00:18:48.836
Thank you for coming with us this episode.

00:18:49.121 --> 00:18:51.100
We brought you from Jordan to Egypt.

00:18:52.912 --> 00:18:54.120
I'm honored and glad.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.092
Thank you very much.

00:18:57.363 --> 00:19:00.343
When the Prophet peace be upon him,
said,"If the Final Hour comes

00:19:00.343 --> 00:19:02.309
while you have a
palm-cutting in your hands

00:19:02.551 --> 00:19:05.979
and it is possible to plant it before
the Hour comes, you should plant it."
