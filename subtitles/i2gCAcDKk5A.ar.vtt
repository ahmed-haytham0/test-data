00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.960
Ruling on wiping the shoes and then removing them when entering the mosque

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.560
Her eminence Sheikh noticed that some Muslims wipe on his shoes for example wearing a stocking

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.580
If he enters the mosque take off the shoe and thinks that the survey with the right picture is true?

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.200
Not what is correct must be the survey on the stocking,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:43.700
If wiping on the sole with the socks and taking off the sole that removes the sock, the wudoo 'is finished, and the wudoo' is performed.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.320
If wiping them all invalidates ablution by removing one of them

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.600
But if the survey is based on the sock and then wearing the shoes or the sole,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.720
then it is not harmful if it is taken off. There is nothing wrong with the ruling on the sock

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.840
If taking off the sole or shoes that is on the socks is not harmful,

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.860
But if all of them are wiped out, the rule is all about them

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.800
If one takes off the hero of wudoo '.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:22.960
It should be noted that the survey on the appearance of the foot only the appearance of the foot does not need to the heel or the bottom of the veil

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.720
When it is clear on the apparent appearance of the Prophet was enough to clear the visible only hidden

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:36.140
I do not have to wipe the heel or wipe the bottom, but the Sunnah only exposes the appearance

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.540
Like Ali said:  If the religion was in the opinion of the bottom of the first of the first survey

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.920
I saw the Prophet wipe on the apparent hidden - peace be upon him -

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.300
The conclusion is that this is the place of wiping the appearance of the khuf and the apparent appearance of the sock

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.420
Here, too, is a question that may be the splint

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:01.680
If a person has a splint on his foot or in his arm or in the face for a wound, he will wipe it

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.860
And it does not have a certain time as long as there is a wipe, even if the length of the period until he heals under it and removes it

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.580
This limit has only limited wellness

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.900
And wipe them all,

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.300
On all splint

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.300
Even if it is placed on non-purity

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.300
Or injured in his hand or in his leg, which is on a light and then put the splint on it

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:31.720
Or placing the doctor on the splint, he will never wipe

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.900
Even if it was placed when placed on a non-wudoo'

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.280
Thus in washing washing janaabah

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.680
If it is in the back to plaster in the back

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.500
Or on the side or splint, it passes water and enough

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.440
There is no need to remove it, but when enough water passes over it

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.400
Until God redeems him.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:04.460
You said that if the pit was on a smaller event, what about the larger event Sheikh Abdul Aziz?

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.900
Such as the above
Even if it happens larger

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.900
If it happens, the ruling is the same?

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.060
Never wipe it with wudoo 'and wash it with water.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.640
May God reward you with good.
