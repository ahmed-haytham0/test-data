Hawawshi was born in Cairo

00:00:15.884 --> 00:00:20.190
It was invented by a butcher in Al-Tawfiqiya market whose name was Ahmed El-Hawawsh

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.937
This was in in 1971

00:00:23.937 --> 00:00:28.624
Al-Hawawsh would season minced meat and onions inside baladi bread

00:00:28.624 --> 00:00:30.506
He would then put those inside an oven

00:00:30.506 --> 00:00:33.989
The meat would cook, and the bread would brown in fat

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.383
Hawawshi made its way to the Delta and was known there

00:00:37.383 --> 00:00:41.644
And Al-Aziziya village in Minya Al-Qamh, Sharqiya, became known for its Hawawshi

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.268
Hawawshi's most basic form is meat cooked inside bread

00:01:25.268 --> 00:01:27.569
This is present in many cultures, like burgers in the US and dumplings in East Asia

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:30.116
And now we see upgrades to the recipe

00:01:30.116 --> 00:01:33.362
Like chicken hawawshi and shrimp hawawshi

00:01:33.362 --> 00:01:35.946
And see new additions to the original recipe

00:01:35.946 --> 00:01:37.601
Like cheese and vegetables

00:01:37.601 --> 00:01:40.006
And the world of hawawshi has many stars

00:01:40.006 --> 00:01:42.006
Like Al-Rifaie in Abdeen

00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:43.886
