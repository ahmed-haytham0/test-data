00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:28.157
Allah created the heavens and earth

00:00:28.637 --> 00:00:30.235
and determined therein its [creatures'] sustenance

00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:32.313
He created in the heavens and earth

00:00:32.313 --> 00:00:33.858
everything we need to live in peace

00:00:34.074 --> 00:00:37.038
until Allah inherits the earth and whoever is on it.

00:00:37.038 --> 00:00:39.640
Earth's lungs are its forests,

00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:40.780
its oceans,

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.059
and its rivers.

00:00:42.174 --> 00:00:43.241
A balance

00:00:43.447 --> 00:00:45.556
that earth's been built upon for billions of years

00:00:45.984 --> 00:00:47.151
Then man came.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.258
Then

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:49.750
man came.

00:00:55.164 --> 00:00:56.543
We destroyed crops and animals.

00:00:56.794 --> 00:00:58.208
We lit the flames of war,

00:00:58.454 --> 00:00:59.327
destroyed

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:00.106
displaced.

00:01:00.294 --> 00:01:01.771
We oppressed one another.

00:01:01.977 --> 00:01:04.352
We spared nothing,

00:01:04.763 --> 00:01:07.225
no human and no animal.

00:01:07.577 --> 00:01:09.129
We spread corruption on earth

00:01:09.308 --> 00:01:11.959
until it complained to its Creator.

00:01:12.463 --> 00:01:14.009
Some people die of hunger,

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:15.205
and others of eating too much.

00:01:15.594 --> 00:01:16.846
Many are forced to flee

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:18.259
so a handful can live in luxury.

00:01:18.407 --> 00:01:19.213
Destruction

00:01:19.421 --> 00:01:20.155
Collapse

00:01:20.155 --> 00:01:21.317
Corruption and injustice

00:01:22.186 --> 00:01:22.863
But

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:25.426
do not despair of Allah's spirit.

00:01:25.868 --> 00:01:26.794
Man

00:01:27.057 --> 00:01:27.831
has a choice.

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:29.484
Just as there is bad,

00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:30.839
there is good.

00:01:31.297 --> 00:01:32.495
In the face of corruption

00:01:32.702 --> 00:01:33.974
stands benevolence.

00:01:33.974 --> 00:01:35.745
With hardship must

00:01:36.089 --> 00:01:37.797
come ease.

00:01:37.837 --> 00:01:39.769
We sent people to the moon,

00:01:39.798 --> 00:01:41.752
and defeated deadly diseases.

00:01:41.858 --> 00:01:43.867
We built skyscrapers,

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:46.268
We've soared between earth and sky.

00:01:46.553 --> 00:01:47.567
We erased illiteracy

00:01:47.567 --> 00:01:49.345
in many parts of the world.

00:01:49.525 --> 00:01:50.286
We've invented,

00:01:50.426 --> 00:01:51.126
risen,

00:01:51.322 --> 00:01:52.196
and built.

00:01:52.402 --> 00:01:54.900
And this is just the beginning of the journey,

00:01:55.194 --> 00:01:57.559
for the journey to excellence is long.

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:58.633
We'll stumble,

00:01:58.838 --> 00:01:59.966
only to stand back up.

00:02:00.128 --> 00:02:01.600
We can overcome

00:02:01.681 --> 00:02:03.413
a mountain of difficulties.

00:02:03.472 --> 00:02:05.840
We must populate and develop the earth.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.114
Is the reward for good [anything] but good?

00:02:14.117 --> 00:02:20.076
"Khawater 11"

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.340
"Behind the Scenes"

00:02:28.621 --> 00:02:29.793
Behind the scenes

00:02:30.335 --> 00:02:31.270
The last episode

00:02:35.298 --> 00:02:35.895
Okay

00:02:36.293 --> 00:02:37.279
Hello

00:02:37.723 --> 00:02:38.356
Action?

00:02:41.833 --> 00:02:43.332
Can this even be fixed?

00:02:50.821 --> 00:02:51.483
Stop

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:52.470
How does it stop?

00:03:05.686 --> 00:03:06.228
That's enough

00:03:06.726 --> 00:03:08.267
Whoa, where did it come from?

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:10.936
What is it with Khawater and dogs?

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:13.779
Hey there

00:03:13.863 --> 00:03:14.874
Come, come

00:03:15.485 --> 00:03:17.706
Some say you won't be doing Khawater anymore.

00:03:17.706 --> 00:03:19.235
This will be the last year.

00:03:22.948 --> 00:03:23.793
Behind the scenes

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:24.989
This is a light episode.

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:29.966
The season was packed with information,

00:03:30.118 --> 00:03:33.074
so we've always tried to end on a light

00:03:33.074 --> 00:03:34.476
and fun note for the viewers.

00:03:34.476 --> 00:03:37.091
We'll show what happened behind the scenes

00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:37.816
of this season.

00:03:38.936 --> 00:03:39.769
He said, "His mother carries him"

00:03:48.274 --> 00:03:51.746
"His mother carried him, [increasing her] in weakness upon weakness"

00:03:51.746 --> 00:03:53.533
Take the whole clip in one shot

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:55.079
but without the screaming

00:03:55.114 --> 00:03:58.573
so people don't turn off the TV.

00:04:01.835 --> 00:04:03.706
You look like...

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.857
They'll say Ahmad has a body guard.

00:04:11.755 --> 00:04:12.394
How are you?

00:04:12.394 --> 00:04:13.753
Everything good?

00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:14.457
Yes

00:04:19.433 --> 00:04:20.969
I used to be like this before

00:04:21.222 --> 00:04:22.445
but not anymore.

00:04:24.675 --> 00:04:25.789
Play 'Ahwak'

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.080
This is the Ahwak remix.

00:04:33.413 --> 00:04:35.436
Wow! That was a good one!

00:04:36.293 --> 00:04:37.510
Okay, tell us what you think

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.268
of Khawater in Portuguese.

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:45.832
That's truly what sets it apart!

00:04:45.875 --> 00:04:48.872
This is the show's secret.

00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:55.403
Ghandour was stung.

00:04:55.554 --> 00:04:56.523
Where? On your ear?

00:04:56.946 --> 00:04:59.669
How does it feel?

00:05:01.026 --> 00:05:01.540
It burns.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.384
You killed the bee.

00:05:03.716 --> 00:05:04.369
Yeah

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.888
He came.

00:05:13.123 --> 00:05:14.943
There's a great project in Sudan,

00:05:15.298 --> 00:05:18.714
the Arab world's food basket.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.478
What is the project with Al Mujadidun?

00:05:21.478 --> 00:05:23.646
The agricultural project...

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:24.367
Me, me

00:05:26.791 --> 00:05:27.353
Nice to meet you

00:05:28.305 --> 00:05:28.939
Ahmad

00:05:29.625 --> 00:05:31.035
I host the show "Khawater".

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:34.424
Explain it to us

00:05:38.098 --> 00:05:38.603
Ahmad

00:05:39.578 --> 00:05:40.153
Nice to meet you

00:05:40.508 --> 00:05:41.816
The show Khawater

00:05:43.135 --> 00:05:45.916
I'm the host

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:49.927
I was just saying I want your attention...

00:06:37.816 --> 00:06:39.170
Are you sure the sound is clear with all the noise?

00:06:39.688 --> 00:06:39.955
Let's start?

00:06:41.677 --> 00:06:42.456
That's the first point.

00:06:42.796 --> 00:06:43.287
Secondly...

00:06:45.153 --> 00:06:46.249
I don't think it'll work for me to talk here.

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:47.397
Is my voice clear?

00:06:47.635 --> 00:06:50.804
I'll make use of the times when it's quiet.

00:06:51.013 --> 00:06:52.863
The issue of child labor and slavery

00:06:54.739 --> 00:06:56.923
They decide to dedicate their lives

00:06:59.098 --> 00:07:00.247
or some of their time

00:07:05.401 --> 00:07:07.229
This is how problems are solved

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:08.303
An example of that today,

00:07:08.303 --> 00:07:09.086
as we have seen...

00:07:10.765 --> 00:07:11.522
In India alone

00:07:14.097 --> 00:07:15.512
The need for freedom is innate.

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:20.725
Filming in India is like this.

00:07:21.072 --> 00:07:24.439
They love to honk.

00:07:25.073 --> 00:07:27.462
Let me hear what's next.

00:07:27.549 --> 00:07:29.952
Wow! Great music.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.096
The land is a grazing ground for camels.

00:07:33.096 --> 00:07:37.237
It is their plate.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.363
Whoa

00:07:39.674 --> 00:07:40.850
What's wrong?

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.209
We don't want to eat.

00:07:47.475 --> 00:07:49.764
A message to the youth about starting

00:07:49.764 --> 00:07:50.520
their projects,

00:07:50.694 --> 00:07:54.662
you don't necessarily have to start a huge project,

00:07:54.662 --> 00:07:56.566
that requires a great budget.

00:07:56.566 --> 00:07:58.222
You can start with a small idea

00:07:58.222 --> 00:08:00.061
and a very simple beginning,

00:08:00.061 --> 00:08:01.712
and subhanallah, with time it'll grow.

00:08:01.712 --> 00:08:03.540
This was my experience with Khawater.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.979
We started very simply,

00:08:04.979 --> 00:08:06.961
and with a very simple pilot episode.

00:08:06.961 --> 00:08:08.401
The performance was low.

00:08:08.523 --> 00:08:09.856
We'll show it to you.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.223
"Khawater Shab"

00:08:11.223 --> 00:08:14.661
"Bathrooms"

00:08:18.888 --> 00:08:21.795
The sewer doesn't work in the bathroom

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:22.793
so the water is overflowing.

00:08:23.045 --> 00:08:24.651
It smells really bad.

00:08:26.616 --> 00:08:28.014
"A restaurant's bathroom"

00:08:28.738 --> 00:08:30.278
This is the second bathroom now.

00:08:30.572 --> 00:08:31.887
There are several things to take note of.

00:08:32.136 --> 00:08:35.155
First, the sinks are the latest model.

00:08:35.329 --> 00:08:36.455
We did two episodes:

00:08:36.563 --> 00:08:37.460
one about happiness

00:08:37.676 --> 00:08:39.720
and another about cleaning bathrooms

00:08:39.734 --> 00:08:43.397
and an invitation to improve mosques' bathrooms.

00:08:43.397 --> 00:08:44.466
We did the pilot,

00:08:44.466 --> 00:08:46.115
in 2005,

00:08:46.513 --> 00:08:50.330
and I was very hesitant about sending the pilot

00:08:51.063 --> 00:08:51.588
to MBC.

00:08:51.667 --> 00:08:55.014
I didn't like it and thought we could make it better

00:08:55.109 --> 00:08:55.941
and that they wouldn't approve

00:08:55.941 --> 00:08:57.672
but we relied on Allah and sent it.

00:08:57.826 --> 00:08:59.324
It was on a VHS.

00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:03.510
Wow!

00:09:03.788 --> 00:09:04.546
The start of Khawater

00:09:06.689 --> 00:09:07.731
Are we filming?

00:09:09.113 --> 00:09:11.402
Sometimes we film without anyone behind the camera.

00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:12.784
it's just on.

00:09:13.111 --> 00:09:15.494
Yes, so this is how Khawater began.

00:09:15.598 --> 00:09:18.144
With time, the project developed

00:09:18.268 --> 00:09:18.964
and if you watch Khawater 1

00:09:18.964 --> 00:09:20.450
and compare it to Khawater 11,

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.371
you'll see a great difference in everything,

00:09:22.371 --> 00:09:24.023
in the production, budget, work,

00:09:24.412 --> 00:09:26.165
performance and in everything.

00:09:39.873 --> 00:09:40.946
The price of gas

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:45.068
The price of gas,

00:09:45.575 --> 00:09:46.905
how much did it cost...

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:52.085
The price of gas

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.997
if we look at the price of gas in 1938

00:10:06.706 --> 00:10:07.365
The need...

00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:14.612
Does he show or not?

00:10:14.825 --> 00:10:15.611
He shows

00:10:16.575 --> 00:10:18.348
Let's have him show in the episode

00:10:18.448 --> 00:10:18.968
Yes

00:10:19.134 --> 00:10:20.225
No, but it won't work.

00:10:20.225 --> 00:10:20.775
Why?

00:10:20.775 --> 00:10:21.890
Because it's a serious episode.

00:10:22.351 --> 00:10:23.017
I'm serious

00:10:27.175 --> 00:10:28.278
The second need:

00:10:28.596 --> 00:10:29.577
Safety

00:10:29.797 --> 00:10:32.611
Humans need to feel safe,

00:10:32.611 --> 00:10:34.320
that they live in a safe place

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.631
and go from their homes to their workplace

00:10:37.631 --> 00:10:39.781
safely, without any threat to their lives.

00:10:42.769 --> 00:10:43.384
I felt like James Bond.

00:10:48.038 --> 00:10:48.728
The question

00:10:48.836 --> 00:10:51.034
You should hand it to someone

00:10:51.299 --> 00:10:52.326
and they...

00:10:53.528 --> 00:10:54.281
It's okay, take it

00:10:54.451 --> 00:10:58.188
You should give it to the person in charge right away

00:10:58.308 --> 00:10:59.125
Delegation

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.236
Normal activities, such as going to the movies,

00:11:03.236 --> 00:11:04.729
in the year 19...

00:11:08.726 --> 00:11:11.910
Even normal activities, such as going to the movies,

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:17.382
cost around 25 cents in 1938.

00:11:21.303 --> 00:11:22.947
I forgot what segment it is.

00:11:23.274 --> 00:11:24.400
478

00:11:24.845 --> 00:11:25.480
Oh, now I know.

00:11:26.988 --> 00:11:28.794
Okay, 478.

00:11:28.874 --> 00:11:30.899
This is one of Khawater's most important segments.

00:11:34.098 --> 00:11:35.278
I can't see you.

00:11:35.703 --> 00:11:36.841
Yes, come next to me.

00:11:38.284 --> 00:11:39.575
Okay, stay like this.

00:11:41.193 --> 00:11:42.729
One of the most...

00:11:47.879 --> 00:11:49.065
We use it every day

00:11:49.065 --> 00:11:51.255
in large amounts

00:11:54.077 --> 00:11:57.087
One of the most used plastic products at home,

00:11:57.087 --> 00:11:58.084
what do you think they are?

00:11:58.084 --> 00:11:59.088
Plastic bottles

00:12:02.507 --> 00:12:03.159
This is a melon.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:08.385
Melon

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:09.302
Marhoom

00:12:11.922 --> 00:12:12.631
Who's marhoom (deceased)?

00:12:15.273 --> 00:12:15.760
Where?

00:12:15.914 --> 00:12:16.596
Algeria

00:12:16.744 --> 00:12:17.366
Algeria!

00:12:17.839 --> 00:12:18.916
Really? I never knew that.

00:12:18.916 --> 00:12:19.677
Melon,

00:12:20.179 --> 00:12:21.128
or Marhoom,

00:12:21.128 --> 00:12:23.313
as our brothers in Algeria call it.

00:12:23.553 --> 00:12:27.205
We just learned a new word from Mr. Osman.

00:12:27.597 --> 00:12:28.803
Tell us more words.

00:12:29.006 --> 00:12:31.128
This is called Zorodiya

00:12:32.122 --> 00:12:33.667
or Sinariya.

00:12:34.252 --> 00:12:35.244
Or Sinariya

00:12:41.813 --> 00:12:44.436
Okay, okay, I think we're stuck.

00:12:57.153 --> 00:12:57.568
We did it.

00:12:58.219 --> 00:12:59.189
Nairobi adventures

00:12:59.461 --> 00:13:00.114
Kenya

00:13:08.478 --> 00:13:09.360
I forgot that I'm fasting.

00:13:11.097 --> 00:13:12.179
Remind me!

00:13:14.104 --> 00:13:14.929
Okay, no problem.

00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:20.746
We'll take it with us when we break our fast.

00:13:21.931 --> 00:13:24.569
My muscle strained immediately.

00:13:25.524 --> 00:13:27.108
This is what happens when you don't

00:13:27.108 --> 00:13:28.632
exercise well.

00:13:31.976 --> 00:13:35.313
She'll try to cure the strain.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.741
Is she getting something with her?

00:13:51.544 --> 00:13:53.638
What did you do?

00:14:03.795 --> 00:14:06.485
Mr. Sid said he'll treat my leg with my hand.

00:14:30.956 --> 00:14:31.497
Okay

00:14:36.488 --> 00:14:36.990
You're kidding!

00:14:38.271 --> 00:14:39.049
You're kidding!

00:14:47.505 --> 00:14:48.629
They found this solution,

00:14:48.856 --> 00:14:51.356
which is like a pump and a filter

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.319
and then...

00:14:55.347 --> 00:14:55.953
Are we doing it wrong?

00:14:58.865 --> 00:14:59.716
There's no water?

00:15:00.138 --> 00:15:02.674
This is a solution that doesn't work.

00:15:02.826 --> 00:15:03.917
Don't do this.

00:15:04.954 --> 00:15:08.167
That's why when the Qur'an mentions wives,

00:15:08.167 --> 00:15:12.026
"And of His signs is that He created for you from

00:15:12.202 --> 00:15:13.897
yourselves mates that you may find tranquillity in them;

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:15.702
and He placed between you..."

00:15:15.871 --> 00:15:16.361
love?

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:17.726
Affection and mercy

00:15:17.895 --> 00:15:20.185
I know, I'm asking the viewers.

00:15:20.878 --> 00:15:21.794
I'm just testing them.

00:15:21.867 --> 00:15:27.077
The show is called...

00:15:28.157 --> 00:15:29.445
What did we call the show?

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.385
As-Salamu 'Alaikum

00:15:33.385 --> 00:15:34.278
Welcome to our show

00:15:35.335 --> 00:15:37.951
Welcome to the show...

00:15:38.619 --> 00:15:42.254
Asalamu 'Alaikum to our viewers

00:15:42.254 --> 00:15:45.361
and welcome to the show 'Hakawika Zawajika'.

00:15:45.443 --> 00:15:47.267
'Hawariko Bain Azawajiko'

00:15:47.298 --> 00:15:48.395
Welcome

00:15:48.685 --> 00:15:50.789
What do you appreciate most about me?

00:15:50.992 --> 00:15:52.344
Your love for me.

00:15:55.891 --> 00:15:57.418
You love me because...

00:15:57.682 --> 00:15:59.390
As much as you have bad qualities...

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:00.177
Thank you

00:16:00.422 --> 00:16:03.522
Bad and ugly qualities, I don't know why but I love you.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:04.986
Walk forward

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.066
She's laughing!

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:16.337
Tell her, I don't know how you manage your life.

00:16:21.384 --> 00:16:21.680
Stop

00:16:22.221 --> 00:16:22.960
Why didn't you tell me to stop?

00:16:23.426 --> 00:16:24.541
I told you to stop, you stepped.

00:16:24.577 --> 00:16:25.310
You told him to stop?

00:16:26.187 --> 00:16:27.179
You didn't.

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:29.838
What is this?

00:16:30.161 --> 00:16:31.152
A jacket

00:16:37.086 --> 00:16:38.639
I mean did you recently receive it?

00:16:38.956 --> 00:16:40.368
From Saudi

00:16:41.985 --> 00:16:43.274
What's wrong?

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:55.561
"Filming of the theme song"

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.375
Anything you liked in the theme song,

00:17:35.414 --> 00:17:36.954
he was in charge.

00:17:53.117 --> 00:17:55.276
To be honest, I haven't decided

00:17:55.276 --> 00:17:58.695
exactly what I want to do after Khawater,

00:17:58.815 --> 00:18:00.148
but what I do know,

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.821
and we've started this before Ramadan,

00:18:02.991 --> 00:18:04.682
is working on creating

00:18:04.682 --> 00:18:07.025
educational and entertaining shows.

00:18:07.025 --> 00:18:10.245
We had the idea of starting a show

00:18:10.245 --> 00:18:12.238
about learning from animals

00:18:12.238 --> 00:18:13.843
and we called it "Omam".

00:18:14.011 --> 00:18:16.791
We also did a light show called "Dr. Cash".

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.367
It gives viewers a financial principle

00:18:19.367 --> 00:18:21.133
at the end of the episode.

00:18:21.229 --> 00:18:21.937
"Top 5"

00:18:21.937 --> 00:18:24.427
is a show that gives general knowledge

00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:30.754
about the top 5 things regarding the topic at hand.

00:18:30.754 --> 00:18:33.128
We also thought to invest the international days

00:18:33.128 --> 00:18:35.141
and came up with a show titled "Internaional Days"

00:18:35.141 --> 00:18:37.356
where, in three or four minutes we clarify

00:18:37.439 --> 00:18:41.087
some ideas about the specific day we're talking about.

00:18:41.087 --> 00:18:43.628
We always tell people not to eat junk food

00:18:43.751 --> 00:18:44.981
and people ask what they should eat instead.

00:18:45.232 --> 00:18:48.482
So we made a show called "Akel Tricks" (Food Tricks).

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:49.960
The show is about healthy food

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:54.525
and information about food and nutrition.

00:18:54.525 --> 00:18:56.121
Of course, there's also the show "Samtan"

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:59.437
that shows after Khawater

00:18:59.588 --> 00:19:00.799
and was also shown last year.

00:19:00.981 --> 00:19:04.452
Inshallah it goes on for more seasons.

00:19:04.643 --> 00:19:06.542
So this is one thing I'm moving towards,

00:19:06.623 --> 00:19:09.247
making more of these shows.

00:19:10.025 --> 00:19:13.641
ARAM creates shows with the aim of educating

00:19:13.641 --> 00:19:15.089
through entertainment.

00:19:18.482 --> 00:19:22.609
We didn't mean to say any false information

00:19:22.609 --> 00:19:26.481
or harm anyone in any of the seasons.

00:19:26.524 --> 00:19:27.673
If that happened,

00:19:27.673 --> 00:19:28.923
and I'm sure it has

00:19:28.923 --> 00:19:30.549
because this is a human project,

00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:31.322
we apologize,

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:32.420
it wasn't meant.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.466
And all praise goes to Allah

00:19:34.615 --> 00:19:40.059
for anything beneficial said.

00:19:40.076 --> 00:19:41.501
Always remember and mention us in prayers

00:19:41.501 --> 00:19:45.396
because I think one of the secrets to Khawater's

00:19:45.408 --> 00:19:48.396
continuity these past years is the viewers' supplication.

00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:50.742
So thank you, thank you very much.

00:19:51.122 --> 00:19:53.666
A special thanks to my parents,

00:19:53.666 --> 00:19:55.759
Rula, my wife,

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:57.236
and Yousef and Ibrahim

00:19:57.386 --> 00:20:00.424
because I was absent these past few years

00:20:00.625 --> 00:20:04.075
and for making it through this last period of time,

00:20:04.196 --> 00:20:05.600
which was very difficult,

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.720
because Khawater was my #1 priority.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.508
A few years ago, I sat with the entire family

00:20:11.508 --> 00:20:17.193
and told them that Khawater will be my priority.

00:20:17.193 --> 00:20:19.476
I thank them all greatly

00:20:19.476 --> 00:20:21.328
and may you be rewarded.

00:20:21.594 --> 00:20:23.901
I thank everyone who worked on Khawater

00:20:23.901 --> 00:20:26.894
and everyone who watched.

00:20:26.894 --> 00:20:29.702
We're honored that you allowed us to

00:20:29.702 --> 00:20:31.732
enter your homes

00:20:31.732 --> 00:20:32.978
and talk to you,

00:20:32.978 --> 00:20:37.529
and to give you our thoughts.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:44.113
And for those who watched us throughout the years,

00:20:44.113 --> 00:20:48.943
and chose Khawater from among hundreds of shows.

00:20:49.018 --> 00:20:51.391
Thank you. Thank you.

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:52.899
May God reward you.

00:20:53.106 --> 00:20:56.350
It was a wonderful, close relationship

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:58.418
that lasted 11 years.

00:20:59.229 --> 00:21:00.198
Thank you very much,

00:21:00.203 --> 00:21:01.444
pray for our success.

00:21:01.444 --> 00:21:05.093
This is the last episode,

00:21:05.429 --> 00:21:08.299
so we'll see you when God wills

00:21:08.299 --> 00:21:10.726
us to see you again inshallah.

00:21:13.308 --> 00:21:16.003
When the Prophet peace be upon him,
said,"If the Final Hour comes

00:21:16.003 --> 00:21:17.942
while you have a
palm-cutting in your hands

00:21:17.942 --> 00:21:21.234
and it is possible to plant it before
the Hour comes, you should plant it."

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:25.863
